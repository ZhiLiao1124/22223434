Developer Blocks and ItemsareBlocksandItemsthat do not spawn inOpen-Worlds, and that developers use to create maps,gamemodes, etc.(They are only accessible byDevelopers, except some exclusive Blocks in certain game modes likeOne BlockandDoodle Cube, obtained by glitches or codes). These are very easy to obtain in worlds usingCode Blocks. They cannot be crafted in any gamemodes, but they could have been previously obtained usingFireballs(inGreenville), obtaining these blocks (in gamemodes other than worlds) are only possible by hackingBloxd.io, using other unknown glitches, or by asking players that have the Illegal Items.

Here is a full list of the items in the game:

Moonstone Axe, obtained before it was deleted from the game files in 2022. It was however, added back as a rebranded item two years later.
Red and Brown Mushroom Block, used to be 2 of the illegal blocks in Bloxd.io (Greenville), but in 2024 it is obtained by crafting with Red or Brown Mushrooms.
Wither Rose (Shadow Rose now), Formerly known as Wither Rose, it is a black flower, illegally collected in the Greenville game mode, similar to other flowers it can be propagated. But after the Frozen Badlands update on May 2, 2025, Wither Rose was renamed to Shadow Rose, collected in the Frozen Badlands biome.
Dim Lamp On, or Blocker, is the firstItemto be added to the game, since they are used inBloxd hop, which is the firstgamemode.
SomeFlowers, such asForget-me-notandAllium, are illegal inGreenville: you cannot get them in Flower Packs. Bluebells are obtained by going to the woodcutting station and harvesting them.
IllegalFlowerscan still be produced as you can farmFlowersusing a square of tilled soil filled in.
Some of theItemshave been found by the players with the help ofglitches.
Mushroom Blocks (Red Mushroom and Brown Mushroom) are no longer an Illegal Item as of May 17, 2024. However,Red and Brown Mushroomsremains illegal inGreenvillebecauseMushroom blocksare Illegal there.
Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks were previously Illegal Blocks.
Because CyanCeramichas aMinecraftCreeper face on it,Arthurcould not add this block to the game, as it would be illegal. However, JanuaryBoy, known as JanuaryBloxd in YT, changed the texture of the block and may have notified the devs or posted on Discord, since it was added on July 6, 2024.
Mushroom Stem is not an illegal block in Greenville as you can get Mushroom Stem in theGreen Mushroom houseand theRed Mushroom House.
Moonstone Axe, Artisan Axe, and Artisan Shears were each in the game for a few days but were later removed.
Barkless Logs used to be illegal, but now they were changed so you can right click a log with an axe to get some. Before that was added, getting Barkless Maple Logs and Barkless Aspen Log inGreenvillewas probably done by blowing up the Woodcutting house with aFireball.
There used to be a bug that Maple Barked Log isn't in the creative menu. The only way to obtain before was chopping the barks of the log. (If your a World Owner and your in Creative, switch gamemode to Peaceful and do the way this trivia entry told. Then bring back your creative.)
Invisible Solid can't mined. It always regenerates right before you would mine it. Only way to break it is withMoonstone Explosive, so careful when placing! Probably it is breakable inCreative, just likeBedrock. Probably with new texture packs added in the game, just useSimpleBetterto break it, Then change your texture pack and put it. (don't put in wrong way again!)
The Block of Emerald and the Block of Lapis Lazuli are secretly hidden in towers near Aspen Forest in theGreenville(Isle of Grove) gamemode.
The Water block can be obtained inSky Warsby repeatedly using a filled water bucket.
Gravel and Yellowstone can be collected inOne Blockas you can collect them in different phases.
Cobweb is no longer an illegal item afterMysterious Ruinswas added to the game.
Cobweb, Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks are no longer illegal blocks.
With the addition to Press To Codesigns& Code Blocks and some new API's, you can now obtain every single illegal blocks within ownedWorlds.
UnlikeFireball and Iceball, Toxin Ball has no firing limit.
If you want some items with this symbol (|), then use it between the crop stages (ex. Rice|FreshlyGrown). The symbol for this is called the vertical bar.

AnarchyInfoDescriptionFight for your mere existence in a brutal persistent open worldDeveloperDirtyFleaSackScript Nameclassic_anarchy
Anarchyis agamemodethat was added on March 11, 2024. The objective of thisSurvival-likegamemodeis to survive and fight. Like inSurvival, players try to stay alive, while in more difficult circumstances. The only differences are the ability to break blocks inside of spawn, and build limit of 1000 blocks, and the removal of tribes and protectors.
Anarchy was removed from the front page of Bloxd on June 7th 2024. Thegamemodeis still accessible through invite links.

Anarchyis agamemodethat is meant to be a harder version ofSurvival. The gamemode removes access to all protectors, allows you to have a maximum of 1 home (opposed to the normal 3), completely removesTribes, spawns Diamonds in veins of 1, and allows players to break blocks in spawn. The gamemode’s thumbnail is the one old thumbnail of the survival gamemode but with visual effects.
Anarchy's thumbnail is a colour-inverted version of the old Survival thumbnail.
In the Bloxd.io Discord server,DirtyFleaSacksaid he "goofed hard" on the day Anarchy was added to Staging. He was most likely referring to the gamemode.
Arthur is the player in the thumbnail.
Although the gamemode is removed from the front page, it is still accessible via the invite links.

Arthuris the creator ofBloxd.io. He is from the United Kingdom. Arthur once worked for Microsoft. When he found out that Microsoft was buying Minecraft, he quit the company and created his own game based on Minecraft. Arthur created the game engine via Noa (a free and open source game engine). Ayaan, an unknown coder, also helped Arthur on the development of the game.
The first game made with the Bloxd.io game engine wasBloxd Hop(formerly know as BloxdHop) byWeiqing. Arthur is friends with Mattzap. Arthur has also created over 15gamemodesforBloxd. He writes the updates he rolls out toBloxdon its Discord Server in the #dev-log channel in theBloxd Discord Server.
Dirty Flea Sack leaked how Arthur chooses new devs (starting from Stardue).
The “dev” (still unofficial) makes a game mode, it was added to a game as a lonely LTM for a few hours.
Arthur looks at the feedback of the game mode.
The “dev” soon creates another game mode, and it gets in a vote with the old one.
Then the dev becomes official.

Weiqingwas the initial developer ofBloxd Hop.Arthurfirst started working onBloxd.ioand then invited Weiqing to make Bloxd Hop using the Bloxd game engine. Bloxd Hop was the first publicly available bloxd.io game, dubbing Weiqing as one of the first creators of the game.
Weiqing and Arthur probably made the first game modeBloxd Hoptogether. Arthur gave Weiqing authority over Bloxd Hop, and Arthur worked behind the scenes making the bloxd game engine. After a while, Arthur took over development ofBloxd Hop, fixing bugs and keeping it up to date with the rest of the bloxd game engine.MattzapMattzap's Discord profile picture.GamemodesOne Block,Greenville,Murder Mystery,The Pit
Mattzapis a friend ofArthur. He was the 3rd developer ofBloxd.io. He created fourgamemodesas of  but now he works on a game that he created called "mageclash.io". Mattzapp normally createdLimited Time Modes.

The level up bar is a bar that increases when you earn XP by killingmobs,farming,mining, or doing other tasks that give XP. It was added in theenchanting update.
The level up bar has a green outline with a black filling inside.
A Level Up Bar Showing at 2 Levels
When you die by a player or mob, your level up bar gets set to half of its previous level.  When you kill someone, your level up bar increases by the amount they lost. If you pass a level, stars appear around the level you are currently in representing celebration for passing a level and a sound is played. The bar increases when earning XP, and can reach as high as level 300.
The max level is 300 so if you try to obtain more XP, you will still have 300 XP.
The XP is known as "Aura XP", possibly a reference to present-day memes known as "brainrot".
There was a glitch allowing the player to gain infinite XP by right clicking any Fully Grown Wheat or Fully Grown Rice.

For a while, it used to be possible to turn Dirt Blocks into Tilled Soil by right-clicking on them twice with Shears. Sometimes the Dirt Block wouldn't change its aspect to Tilled Soil, but still looked like Dirt, even though it was acting like Tilled Soil. This way it was possible to create a Flower farm where the ground was Dirt. Shears no longer have the ability to till soil, so such farms are now impossible.

A Banana is a food that was added on 7/3/2025. When consumed, it gives Double Jump.
It is an overly curved banana with yellow pixels as its skin and brown pixels to show its ends.
Bananas give you the double jump effect when you eat it. It grows from the Banana seed, which acts like aWatermelon/Melon/PumpkinSeed (grows its food block any of the available 4 directions).
Found on:  7/4/2025
Patched on: 7/5/2025
If you eat a banana, you might get infinite double jump. This is unfair as you can avoid fall damage, (By jumping as you reach the ground. It will reset the blocks you have fallen) get the ability to jump more blocks without using jump potions and dodging attacks will be easier.
Found on: 7/4/2025
Patched on: 7/5/2025
If you eat 1 Banana it will give you Double Jump. But if you eat more than 1 it will no longer be Double Jump but Multi Jump. And combined with the Infinity Double Jump bug you will be multi jumping forever.
Unfortunately this banana is not realistic. They added banana seeds, not banana trees.
The other food added to the Jungle update is theMango.

4Trivia
Players spawn with invincibility shields around them. They cannot be damaged. They then get to choose weapons and fight against another team. Each team has 3 lives. When your team loses, it loses a life. When you have no more lives, you are defeated and are ‘out of the arena’. The last team standing ‘wins the arena’. After fighting for a while, a border resembling red patterned glass appears. When you get out of the border (which shrinks to a tall pillar later in the game), you receive Poison XVI, or Poison 16. Once a player dies, they stay in a room with other killed players and none of them can get damaged, although you can still use the items and fall into the void. When all pairs of teams have fought against each other and have one team victorious, the next round starts after a few seconds.
The Battle Arena gamemode’s thumbnail once again features players with default names, all starting with “BraveTurkey”.
Battle Arena is the third gamemode with gameplay mainly focusing on PvP, the first beingThe Pit, a removed gamemode with a similar concept where players jump down a giant pit into a free-for-all PvP arena and the second beingDuels, a 2v2 PvP fight with a similar concept to Battle Arena.
Battle Arena is the second gamemode to not be featured in theUpdate Logsince the Update Log’s creation, the first beingLucky Towers.
Battle Arena is the second gamemode to feature a ‘survival border’, the first being inSurvival Royalewhere it resembled present-day Gray Patterned Glass.

They also have red eyes and deal a great amount of knockback.
Bears tend to mainly spawn in Pine forests with other mobs in the wildlife update.
Bears are hostile, they attack you if you get too close to them, they have a large hit box so they are easy to hit. They have an Hostility Radius of 12 blocks.

Purchased from their respective prices in the shop.
Buying a house containing a Bed (Wooden House, Hobbit Hole, Japanese House, Gated Wooden House, Country House, Green Mushroom House, Red Mushroom, and Treehouse).
Main page:Sleeping
Interacting (this action will be called “Sleeping” in further logs) with any variant of a bed activates the Sleeping Mechanic, in which the game will do these two functions:
Sleeping on a bed sets your spawn point on the bed. Dying by any means teleports you back to the last spawn point (= Last bed ) you have set. If you had slept in multiple beds, the game will respawn you in the most recent bed you have slept in. If the last bed you have slept in has been destroyed or you have never slept in a bed in the server, it will instead teleport you to the Spawn of the lobby.
This isn’t really relevant to beds, but note that sleeping is only one way of setting spawn points, so interacting with “Set Spawn” boards or stepping on a checkpoint block removes the bed spawn. Remember, the game will respawn you in the most recent spawn point set.
When sleeping in a bed, the game will open a UI, in which you can select one of 5 specific buffs (Increased Damage, Haste, Speed Boost, Farming Yield, and Aura). Selecting one and clicking/tapping on the “Wake Up” button closes the UI and grants you the chosen buff. (Note that once you sleep, the game will not let you wake up unless 10 seconds have passed to avoid spamming buffs). The length of the buffs (and potency) change depending on the variant of the bed, with the Leaf Bed being the shortest and the Strong Bed being the longest. Sleep buffs cannot stack, and waking up when a sleep buff is already active will overwrite the previous buff.
Beds spawn when a game starts, with each team having one. While the bed is still present, whenever a player dies, they can respawn after (or longer if they wish) 5 seconds. Farther into the game, it will take 10 seconds to respawn.
Beds can also be upgraded to a Strong Bed using 12 Moonstone, which makes it ceramic like texture.
There is currently a glitch where you can't right click beds in Bedwars, making it slightly difficult to place bed defenses. (pls remove when patched)
In some large maps such as Cutthroat Cliffs, Beds are found in some areas of the map (such as the lower floors of the pirate ships). These Beds are purely cosmetical and does not function like they do in sandbox and worlds when interacted with, although they can be mined and placed therefore being one way of bridging or towering up.
Beds are used to restore the players energy, each Bed or Bed Level increases the amount of money earned with the regenerated energy.
Beds can be found on some maps. You can easily obtain it in at any maps (someone prove it). It might have a useless purpose, but it is sometimes used as bridging. Instead of using blocks, you can stack the beds on top of each other (bed heads only) to make a towering bridge.
When you die, there is a Lime Bed in your hotbar which allows you to play another game,
In Bedwars, beds are used for spawn points for any players who died. When the opponent’s bed is destroyed, the player will not to be able to respawn again.
Bedsare used to clutch on the top of a block when the distance between the next block is too great. Instead of placing it on a wall, you place it on the top of a block, like Obsidian or Leaves because they are 2x1 blocks, and cannot be placed in some cases. To do a Bed Block Clutch, set up a 6 Block Gap with no blocks in between. In regular parkour, you cannot execute this jump without using Potions or B hopping. Since the Bed is a 2x1 block, you can jump, place the bed down on the block, and another block will appear in front of you, which is the Bed Head. Crouch to the edge of the Head, and jump to the next block, and place another Bed down. You can repeat this over and over unless you run out of Beds or you fall.
If the distance between a block and another block is more than 7 blocks, you cannot do this jump without Potions (ig you can with b-hop III but it's incredibly difficult), but with Spawn Clutching, you can. By putting a Bed down on the block you can't jump to, if you set your respawn point there, the next time you die, you will respawn back on the bed. This may lead to death.
Aim your Crosshair a bed. If you see the message “Set spawn point”, then you successfully set spawn point on that bed (for PC players).
Click the bed with your fingers. If you see the message “Set spawn point”, then you successfully set spawn point on that bed (for Mobile players).

The Bed is 2 blocks long, so if you try to place it in a 1x1 area, it will not work.
InSky Wars, you used to be able to place a Lime Bed, which would trigger the "Play Again" Bed that's supposed to only be in your inventory after the round was over. A player would be sent to a new lobby even though the old one hadn't finished.
You are still able to respawn even if your bed has been covered.
Half Beds are obtained only byglitches.
Find a half Tall Grass and place a Bed on the Tall Grass. Break the half Tall Grass and the half of the Bed that is on top of the half Tall Grass will break without the rest of the Bed breaking. This glitch also works onDoors.
Place a Bed on chunk borders, so that one half of the Bed is in one chunk and the other half in another chunk. (Turn on chunk coordinates in settings to help yourself locate the right place). Then leave and rejoin the lobby. The Beds should now be replaced by half Beds. Though, take note that it doesn't always work. Try breaking the Beds and rejoining again. This way, you will also dupe the Beds.
Half Beds can also be used to make long Beds, double Beds, halfDoorsand half Tall Grass. InPirates, you can also find Half Beds, but you will be poisoned as you must venture out of the allowed area. You can go see them when you are in Spectator. The half beds have been removed.
You have an ability to spawn a bed color available from Bedwars. However, you can glitch it by having 1 CLB (Custom Lobby Block for short) spawn 1 bed, and the other CLB facing at the bed, and picking a bed. This allows it to glitch into a half bed.

Bedwarsis a teamworkPvPGame Mode. It was first seen instaging.bloxd.iobut was then moved toBloxd.io. You battle your opponents on islands floating in the sky. Protect yourBedand try to break your opponents’Bedto prevent them from respawning in order to win. You must kill all the opponents without them respawning to win the game. Even if your team wins, you will not technically win according to your stats list if you permanently die before they win. If you accidently fall into the void, you can save yourself by placing towers in the void. This trick can also be useful if you are losing; you could jump into the void on purpose and save yourself by placing towers in the void (this will make you survive longer).

DiamondIsland, also known asMid,which is shorthand forMiddle, is in the center of most maps inBed Wars, and it hasDiamondgenerators. In Wood Factory, a Duos map (see below), there are fourDiamondislands, each with its ownDiamondgenerator.
The moonstone islands are used for spawning moonstones, hence the name. you can bridge easily to an enemy base inSquads/Triosgame mode. inSolos/Duos, however, you can't use the moonstone islands to bridge to the enemy base, because in squads/trios, the islands arebetween the bases, but in solos/duos, the islands arenext to the mid, so that means you can't do it in duos/solos.
Changed map names.
NPC (or seller) added.
Discount on some Items (eg Fireball), and increased price of some Items (eg Moonstone Explosive).
Lucky Items added.
Fall Damage added.
Sometimes if you kill a player, there will be a sound like a a swish.
If you get a final kill, there will be a sound like a sack crashing to the ground.
if your bed gets destroyed, there will be afireballsound.
if you break an enemy bed, then there will be a muffled sound.

Bedwars SolosInfoDescriptionDestroy your enemies beds to win! Play without teammatesDeveloperArthurScript Namebedwars_solo
Solosis aBedwarssub-gamemode. Unlike the originalBedwars, you only had one person per team, hence the name "solos". This was exactly the same asDuos, the same maps and such, but you had only yourself to trust. This is good for players who want "all the credit" or are just looking for a challenge. Note that if you want a single-player team just like Solos,Sky Warshas relatively the same mechanics. On October 18, 2024, this gamemode came back.

Players will spawn with aWoodenSwordand wearing coloredWoodenArmorrepresenting their Team color, both of which can be upgraded in the shop using four resources:Coal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamonds, in order of rarity and power. Players are divided into groups of one, two, three or four depending on whether it's a game of Solos, Duos, Trios, or Squads and have to protect theirBedwithBlocksfrom the shop, such as Wool, that can be bought with said materials.Soloswas removed in a gamemode vote against Squads, but was added back on Oct. 18, 2024. There are multiple phases of the game that allowMoonstoneandDiamondsto spawn faster and even causeBedsto be deleted (to speed the game up a little).
Because you can't get moonstone and diamonds on your own island, it is key that you either have a bridger to retrieve moonstone to get upgrades for the team and diamonds to give others diamond armor, or loyal players that don't hog resources and buy bricks and cover their bed with it. The bricks will take lots of time to break and that gives the team time to put up a defense without superior gear. Although the latter strat is defensive and can't really win games.
Each Team has their ownBedin the color of the Team. When an enemy breaks your Bed, you will still be alive, but after dying once, you will be lost and be put into spectator mode. You can't break your own team's Bed. Beds also don't blow up if you place a Moonstone Explosive on them, but they can otherwise be broken very easily, even with a fist. From 2:30 minutes after the game starts, The bed is aReinforced Bed, it is partially made out of Iron. Breaking it with a Pickaxe will be faster. After that, the Bed will turn in to aWood Bed.Breaking it by Axe will be faster. After breaking a Bed, there will be a muffled sound. When playing Solo, there will be 8 colors of Beds. There is an Upgrade available that makes your Bed permanently Reinforced for the length of 1 game.
AGeneratoris aBlockinBedwarsthat materials such asCoal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamondsspawn on top of.MoonstoneandDiamondgenerators get upgraded over time without payment of any type in phases such as "Moonstone 2" and "Diamond 3". When these upgrades reach their end, all Beds will be destroyed. There is also a warning in the chat saying 
“Beds destroyed. No more respawns!”.
Base Generators, the generators that spawn Coal and Iron, can be upgraded with Team Upgrades, which are paid for usingMoonstone. Upgrades cause generators to spawn their respective materials more often. The team upgrade "Generator III" causes diamonds to spawn in the Team generator as well.
Each Team has one generator in their base, which producesCoalandIron. 2Coalspawn approximately every second, and 2Iron BarsSpawn approximately every 20 seconds. The Generator can be upgraded usingMoonstone, then it will spawnCoalandIronfaster and even spawnDiamondsat upgrade Generator III.
These areMoonstoneandDiamond Blocks,respectively, placed on islands around the map. TheBlockscan't be mined. The map is symmetrical so all teams have the same distance to the generators. The generators upgrade over time and start producing faster.
The shop used to be accessed by pressing [B] while you are inside ANY base. Now however, one must click on an entity named “items” (has a blue skin) or an entity named “Upgrades” (black skin). The “Items” Mob has four sections: recommended,Blocks, Combat, and Utility. The “Upgrades” mob has only 1: Team upgrades. You can now also access Upgrades through the Shop Entity. When there are Lucky Items available, another section appears in the Shop just for them.
Lucky items are added once per 2 or more weeks. The most up to date ones are the Balloon [go up and drift slowly down] and the Launch Pad [launches anyone who steps on it straight to the middle island!]
When you die and respawn, you will lose all the Items you had in yourInventoryand hotbar. Upon respawning, you will lose your Items. However,Armoryou bought, as well asShears, Sword , Pickaxe, and Axewill not disappear when you respawn. You will also still be affected by the team upgrades. Swords, Pickaxes, and Axes will loose a tier when you respawn, from Diamond to Iron, Iron to Stone, and Stone to Wood.
There are twoChestsin every base. One is a Moonstone chest, and the other is a normal chest.
This chest, also known as a team chest, can be opened only by the team in whose base it is located. You can open this chest in your base and place items in it. Other members of your team will be able to take the items out, but opposing teams won't. When a whole team dies, everyone can open their team chest.
Thischestworks the same as the usualMoonstone Chest. Only you can access the items you put in it, and can use anyMoonstone Chestfrom any base, regardless if its your team or not. If you die, the items in yourMoonstone Chestwill still be there when you respawn. When you get a final kill, you will get all the items inside the playersMoonstone Chestthat you killed.
You can put only certain items into theMoonstone Chest. These areCoal,Iron Bars,Diamonds,Moonstone, and Blocks you bought at the shop, likeWool. You can't put utilities and weapons, such as swords, fireballs, etc., into theMoonstone Chest.
The NPC, better known as the "Seller" or the "Trader", is main access to the Shop. Its sell some items for the current match. Pressing the "B" key in range of the Seller will also open up its menu. There will be 2 sellers at every team-base. One seller sells blocks, food, combat weapons, and tools; and the other sells team upgrades for your team.
Scary Hollow is a map colored brown. Scary Hollow was the first map introduced toBedwars. Scary Hollow also introduced two newBlocks: Useless Soil and Magma. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to the neighboring base.
Roads is a map that is decorated with roads. TheMoonstoneislands are made into traffic cones. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
This map is of a bonsai forest. It is kind of like the Pagoda Map in Bedwars Trios & Squads. It usedAspenWoodPlanks, which were occasionally taken advantage of for hiding. The planks have since been replaced withPalmWoodplanks, introducing a new type ofWood.Concreteis placed as theLeavesof the big tree onDiamondIsland, which was also taken advantage of for hiding. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to any neighboring base.
Nuclear is a map taking place in an abandoned nuclear reactor. Be aware that there are holes in the center island, which you may fall through. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Pineis a large map where everything is situated between tall mountains. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Instead of the usual circular map, the map is now in a rectangular shape. TheDiamondandMoonstonelocations have been spread out across the map instead of being at the usual locations. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theDiamondisland and then to the base opposite yours. Also, take advantage of the tall buildings that can be used to hide orBlockclutches.
Solar is a map themed around the solar system. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly to the neighboring base and destroy their bed(s).
Wheat is a map with a farm motive. The bases are very near to the middle, so the best rushing strategy is to bridge to the middle and then to an enemy base. It's possible the enemies won't even have a Bed defense yet, allowing for the elimination of a team or two very quickly.
Wheat is a very unique map because the beds are separated from the main section of the base and at a lower level (x). You can go to the bed by going down the stairs connecting it with the main section of the base.
Extradia is an airport-themed map. It is one of the big Squads maps. The bases are very far apart so you can either bridge to the Moonstone islands or to the middle first and then over to the other bases. Note that this will take a long time and the enemies will have made a Bed defense by then.
Knaul is a smaller map; the bases are very near to the middle, allowing you to bridge to other base very quickly. You can either go over the Moonstone islands or over the middle in two other ways.
This map has a lot of obstacles and decorations, especially in the middle, meaning that it has a lot of good hiding spots.
Wide-and-Wild (a forest-themed map) is a bigger map; the middle is further away from the bases. However, the Moonstone islands aren't at all separated from the main one and are also slightly nearer to the bases, allowing you to bridge there first and then still access all the other parts of the middle.
Wasteland is a treasure-themed map. It used to be called "Western" It is a big Squads map. The bases are very far apart so it is easier to bridge to the middle first and then over to other bases.
Pagoda (a Japanese-themed map) is one of the smallest squads map, it is easier to bridge to the opponent's island. it is also the first map in Bedwars squads having 4 Diamond Spawners
Ahoy is a pirate themed map. Each base is actually a pirate ship.
Colosseum is a map that looks like ancient ruins. The map was released in Spring 2025. It is created byHarry.This includes Tai Chi spawners, and Diamond Spawners.
The map, again has been introduced by Harry. The map was built by some testers (unconfirmed if more than 1 player). This map includes the map almost like Wood Factory, with buildings and some cranes.
This map is introduced by Harry, on the date when the map Rooftop was added. This map introduces houses, with some village theme in the map.
Right-Hand Display during game
The Right-hand Display is the display that appears on the right of your screen. When you are not in a game and on the waiting screen, the statistics List will be shown. It includes your Wins, Kills, Final Kills (kills you got on a team whose Bed was gone) and Games Played. If you are in a game or viewing a game (via spectator mode), the Team Status will be shown. Every time you win aBedwarsgame, one win will be added to your Stats List. Every time you play aBedwarsgame, one game will be added to your stats list. The Team Status display shows the status of all the Teams. If a green tick or checkmark is shown, they still have theirBed. If a number is shown, they do not have theirBed, and the number shown is the number of players still alive. If a red cross or "X" is shown, it means the team is eliminated.

If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go fullscreen" or the F11 key. Another way is to crouch with C, the other Ctrl, or any other key you assigned to crouching in the keybinds settings.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the bed. Try to be sneaky.
If the game has been going on for quite a while, you should, before attacking other bases, prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and aStick. After breaking their bed, try hitting the players with the stick if they are near the edge.
You can also rush quickly after the start of a game if your sweaty or good. A goodpickaxe(or explosive),PvPskills, and blocking skills are required. This strategy yields many more wins but is dangerous if your teammates aren't good or if no one protects your bed.
If you fall off and die in early-game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can increase your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
There is another unfair way to play, although it doesn't work anymore. Set the vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothing. This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunks at null.
Remember to crouch when hiding.
When looking to escape from other players, an option is to buy wool and pillar to maximum build height, optionally breaking blocks underneath with shears. However, this technique can be countered using ladders, bows, fireballs, or golden watermelon slices.
Pillar up to about y = 100, then slowly bridge until you are directly above someone's Bed. drop a large number of Moonstone Explosive, or jump down, destroy it, and return to your bridge immediately by pillaring.
The game description has an error in it. It states, "Destroy your enemies beds to win!" but the word "enemies" should be "enemies'’" with an apostrophe, to make it "Destroy your enemies' beds to win!".
There are now Cobwebs orGlassin the corners of many maps, which makes it more annoying toPvP.
You can now create your own custom bedwars game/map in Creative mode and than put it in Bedwars.
Bedwars was called "Bed Wars" before.
Duos used to be a sub-gamemode of Bedwars.
Both Bedwars Duos and Bedwars squads changed thumbnails on 7/19/2024. Plots also changed its thumbnail on the same day.
When a map has a Risky Buissness modifier, players were able to exceed numbers that are beyond the stack limit (for example: 3162 Coal. The stack limit is 999). This is because it promised players that if they killed a player, their current loot in their inventory will bedoubled, and large amounts would not have enough inventory space to fill the entire ores, so they are forced tooverstackon each other.First Thumbnail (Duos)Second Thumbnail (Duos)Third Thumbnail (Duos)First Thumbnail (Squads)Second Thumbnail (Squads)Current Thumbnail
Explosives cannot destroy Beds in Bedwars and are only used to destroy the Blocks protecting the Bed.
You can prank your own teammates while Bridging. How to do this:
1. At the start of the game, buy Shears.  2.If one of your teammates starts making a bridge made out of Wool, use the Shears to mine the Wool below him. This can be very funny. It also works in Pirates. This troll, however, is totallynot recommended.
On July 26, 2024, Chests were added to the Bedwars squadsWesternmap, which previously didn't have anynormal ChestsorMoonstone Chests.
Some people don't like the new Bedwars thumbnail, and some don't care.
The Solos Mode was added again as a permanent game mode on October 18, 2024. The 4v4v4v4 mode renamed to "Squads" on the same day.
When your team’s Bed is destroyed, there is a sound effect of a Fireball explosion.

Bedwarsis a teamworkPvPGame Mode. It was first seen instaging.bloxd.iobut was then moved toBloxd.io. You battle your opponents on islands floating in the sky. Protect yourBedand try to break your opponents’Bedto prevent them from respawning in order to win. You must kill all the opponents without them respawning to win the game. Even if your team wins, you will not technically win according to your stats list if you permanently die before they win. If you accidently fall into the void, you can save yourself by placing towers in the void. This trick can also be useful if you are losing; you could jump into the void on purpose and save yourself by placing towers in the void (this will make you survive longer).

DiamondIsland, also known asMid,which is shorthand forMiddle, is in the center of most maps inBed Wars, and it hasDiamondgenerators. In Wood Factory, a Duos map (see below), there are fourDiamondislands, each with its ownDiamondgenerator.
The moonstone islands are used for spawning moonstones, hence the name. you can bridge easily to an enemy base inSquads/Triosgame mode. inSolos/Duos, however, you can't use the moonstone islands to bridge to the enemy base, because in squads/trios, the islands arebetween the bases, but in solos/duos, the islands arenext to the mid, so that means you can't do it in duos/solos.
Changed map names.
NPC (or seller) added.
Discount on some Items (eg Fireball), and increased price of some Items (eg Moonstone Explosive).
Lucky Items added.
Fall Damage added.
Sometimes if you kill a player, there will be a sound like a a swish.
If you get a final kill, there will be a sound like a sack crashing to the ground.
if your bed gets destroyed, there will be afireballsound.
if you break an enemy bed, then there will be a muffled sound.

Bedwars SolosInfoDescriptionDestroy your enemies beds to win! Play without teammatesDeveloperArthurScript Namebedwars_solo
Solosis aBedwarssub-gamemode. Unlike the originalBedwars, you only had one person per team, hence the name "solos". This was exactly the same asDuos, the same maps and such, but you had only yourself to trust. This is good for players who want "all the credit" or are just looking for a challenge. Note that if you want a single-player team just like Solos,Sky Warshas relatively the same mechanics. On October 18, 2024, this gamemode came back.

Bedwars SquadsInfoDescriptionDestroy your enemies beds to win! Play in teams of 4DeveloperArthurScript Namebedwars_4v4v4v4

Players will spawn with aWoodenSwordand wearing coloredWoodenArmorrepresenting their Team color, both of which can be upgraded in the shop using four resources:Coal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamonds, in order of rarity and power. Players are divided into groups of one, two, three or four depending on whether it's a game of Solos, Duos, Trios, or Squads and have to protect theirBedwithBlocksfrom the shop, such as Wool, that can be bought with said materials.Soloswas removed in a gamemode vote against Squads, but was added back on Oct. 18, 2024. There are multiple phases of the game that allowMoonstoneandDiamondsto spawn faster and even causeBedsto be deleted (to speed the game up a little).
Because you can't get moonstone and diamonds on your own island, it is key that you either have a bridger to retrieve moonstone to get upgrades for the team and diamonds to give others diamond armor, or loyal players that don't hog resources and buy bricks and cover their bed with it. The bricks will take lots of time to break and that gives the team time to put up a defense without superior gear. Although the latter strat is defensive and can't really win games.
Each Team has their ownBedin the color of the Team. When an enemy breaks your Bed, you will still be alive, but after dying once, you will be lost and be put into spectator mode. You can't break your own team's Bed. Beds also don't blow up if you place a Moonstone Explosive on them, but they can otherwise be broken very easily, even with a fist. From 2:30 minutes after the game starts, The bed is aReinforced Bed, it is partially made out of Iron. Breaking it with a Pickaxe will be faster. After that, the Bed will turn in to aWood Bed.Breaking it by Axe will be faster. After breaking a Bed, there will be a muffled sound. When playing Solo, there will be 8 colors of Beds. There is an Upgrade available that makes your Bed permanently Reinforced for the length of 1 game.
AGeneratoris aBlockinBedwarsthat materials such asCoal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamondsspawn on top of.MoonstoneandDiamondgenerators get upgraded over time without payment of any type in phases such as "Moonstone 2" and "Diamond 3". When these upgrades reach their end, all Beds will be destroyed. There is also a warning in the chat saying 
“Beds destroyed. No more respawns!”.
Base Generators, the generators that spawn Coal and Iron, can be upgraded with Team Upgrades, which are paid for usingMoonstone. Upgrades cause generators to spawn their respective materials more often. The team upgrade "Generator III" causes diamonds to spawn in the Team generator as well.
Each Team has one generator in their base, which producesCoalandIron. 2Coalspawn approximately every second, and 2Iron BarsSpawn approximately every 20 seconds. The Generator can be upgraded usingMoonstone, then it will spawnCoalandIronfaster and even spawnDiamondsat upgrade Generator III.
These areMoonstoneandDiamond Blocks,respectively, placed on islands around the map. TheBlockscan't be mined. The map is symmetrical so all teams have the same distance to the generators. The generators upgrade over time and start producing faster.
The shop used to be accessed by pressing [B] while you are inside ANY base. Now however, one must click on an entity named “items” (has a blue skin) or an entity named “Upgrades” (black skin). The “Items” Mob has four sections: recommended,Blocks, Combat, and Utility. The “Upgrades” mob has only 1: Team upgrades. You can now also access Upgrades through the Shop Entity. When there are Lucky Items available, another section appears in the Shop just for them.
Lucky items are added once per 2 or more weeks. The most up to date ones are the Balloon [go up and drift slowly down] and the Launch Pad [launches anyone who steps on it straight to the middle island!]
When you die and respawn, you will lose all the Items you had in yourInventoryand hotbar. Upon respawning, you will lose your Items. However,Armoryou bought, as well asShears, Sword , Pickaxe, and Axewill not disappear when you respawn. You will also still be affected by the team upgrades. Swords, Pickaxes, and Axes will loose a tier when you respawn, from Diamond to Iron, Iron to Stone, and Stone to Wood.
There are twoChestsin every base. One is a Moonstone chest, and the other is a normal chest.
This chest, also known as a team chest, can be opened only by the team in whose base it is located. You can open this chest in your base and place items in it. Other members of your team will be able to take the items out, but opposing teams won't. When a whole team dies, everyone can open their team chest.
Thischestworks the same as the usualMoonstone Chest. Only you can access the items you put in it, and can use anyMoonstone Chestfrom any base, regardless if its your team or not. If you die, the items in yourMoonstone Chestwill still be there when you respawn. When you get a final kill, you will get all the items inside the playersMoonstone Chestthat you killed.
You can put only certain items into theMoonstone Chest. These areCoal,Iron Bars,Diamonds,Moonstone, and Blocks you bought at the shop, likeWool. You can't put utilities and weapons, such as swords, fireballs, etc., into theMoonstone Chest.
The NPC, better known as the "Seller" or the "Trader", is main access to the Shop. Its sell some items for the current match. Pressing the "B" key in range of the Seller will also open up its menu. There will be 2 sellers at every team-base. One seller sells blocks, food, combat weapons, and tools; and the other sells team upgrades for your team.
Scary Hollow is a map colored brown. Scary Hollow was the first map introduced toBedwars. Scary Hollow also introduced two newBlocks: Useless Soil and Magma. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to the neighboring base.
Roads is a map that is decorated with roads. TheMoonstoneislands are made into traffic cones. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
This map is of a bonsai forest. It is kind of like the Pagoda Map in Bedwars Trios & Squads. It usedAspenWoodPlanks, which were occasionally taken advantage of for hiding. The planks have since been replaced withPalmWoodplanks, introducing a new type ofWood.Concreteis placed as theLeavesof the big tree onDiamondIsland, which was also taken advantage of for hiding. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to any neighboring base.
Nuclear is a map taking place in an abandoned nuclear reactor. Be aware that there are holes in the center island, which you may fall through. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Pineis a large map where everything is situated between tall mountains. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Instead of the usual circular map, the map is now in a rectangular shape. TheDiamondandMoonstonelocations have been spread out across the map instead of being at the usual locations. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theDiamondisland and then to the base opposite yours. Also, take advantage of the tall buildings that can be used to hide orBlockclutches.
Solar is a map themed around the solar system. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly to the neighboring base and destroy their bed(s).
Wheat is a map with a farm motive. The bases are very near to the middle, so the best rushing strategy is to bridge to the middle and then to an enemy base. It's possible the enemies won't even have a Bed defense yet, allowing for the elimination of a team or two very quickly.
Wheat is a very unique map because the beds are separated from the main section of the base and at a lower level (x). You can go to the bed by going down the stairs connecting it with the main section of the base.
Extradia is an airport-themed map. It is one of the big Squads maps. The bases are very far apart so you can either bridge to the Moonstone islands or to the middle first and then over to the other bases. Note that this will take a long time and the enemies will have made a Bed defense by then.
Knaul is a smaller map; the bases are very near to the middle, allowing you to bridge to other base very quickly. You can either go over the Moonstone islands or over the middle in two other ways.
This map has a lot of obstacles and decorations, especially in the middle, meaning that it has a lot of good hiding spots.
Wide-and-Wild (a forest-themed map) is a bigger map; the middle is further away from the bases. However, the Moonstone islands aren't at all separated from the main one and are also slightly nearer to the bases, allowing you to bridge there first and then still access all the other parts of the middle.
Wasteland is a treasure-themed map. It used to be called "Western" It is a big Squads map. The bases are very far apart so it is easier to bridge to the middle first and then over to other bases.
Pagoda (a Japanese-themed map) is one of the smallest squads map, it is easier to bridge to the opponent's island. it is also the first map in Bedwars squads having 4 Diamond Spawners
Ahoy is a pirate themed map. Each base is actually a pirate ship.
Colosseum is a map that looks like ancient ruins. The map was released in Spring 2025. It is created byHarry.This includes Tai Chi spawners, and Diamond Spawners.
The map, again has been introduced by Harry. The map was built by some testers (unconfirmed if more than 1 player). This map includes the map almost like Wood Factory, with buildings and some cranes.
This map is introduced by Harry, on the date when the map Rooftop was added. This map introduces houses, with some village theme in the map.
Right-Hand Display during game
The Right-hand Display is the display that appears on the right of your screen. When you are not in a game and on the waiting screen, the statistics List will be shown. It includes your Wins, Kills, Final Kills (kills you got on a team whose Bed was gone) and Games Played. If you are in a game or viewing a game (via spectator mode), the Team Status will be shown. Every time you win aBedwarsgame, one win will be added to your Stats List. Every time you play aBedwarsgame, one game will be added to your stats list. The Team Status display shows the status of all the Teams. If a green tick or checkmark is shown, they still have theirBed. If a number is shown, they do not have theirBed, and the number shown is the number of players still alive. If a red cross or "X" is shown, it means the team is eliminated.
Added on November 13, 2024. In its history, 9 Items have been added. Of these, 7 appear as Items.
All lucky Items are enabled.
Generators start at Level 2 for all Teams.
A Launch Pad is given immediately to every Team.

If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go fullscreen" or the F11 key. Another way is to crouch with C, the other Ctrl, or any other key you assigned to crouching in the keybinds settings.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the bed. Try to be sneaky.
If the game has been going on for quite a while, you should, before attacking other bases, prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and aStick. After breaking their bed, try hitting the players with the stick if they are near the edge.
You can also rush quickly after the start of a game if your sweaty or good. A goodpickaxe(or explosive),PvPskills, and blocking skills are required. This strategy yields many more wins but is dangerous if your teammates aren't good or if no one protects your bed.
If you fall off and die in early-game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can increase your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
There is another unfair way to play, although it doesn't work anymore. Set the vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothing. This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunks at null.
Remember to crouch when hiding.
When looking to escape from other players, an option is to buy wool and pillar to maximum build height, optionally breaking blocks underneath with shears. However, this technique can be countered using ladders, bows, fireballs, or golden watermelon slices.
Pillar up to about y = 100, then slowly bridge until you are directly above someone's Bed. drop a large number of Moonstone Explosive, or jump down, destroy it, and return to your bridge immediately by pillaring.
The game description has an error in it. It states, "Destroy your enemies beds to win!" but the word "enemies" should be "enemies'’" with an apostrophe, to make it "Destroy your enemies' beds to win!".
There are now Cobwebs orGlassin the corners of many maps, which makes it more annoying toPvP.
You can now create your own custom bedwars game/map in Creative mode and than put it in Bedwars.
Bedwars was called "Bed Wars" before.
Duos used to be a sub-gamemode of Bedwars.
Both Bedwars Duos and Bedwars squads changed thumbnails on 7/19/2024. Plots also changed its thumbnail on the same day.
When a map has a Risky Buissness modifier, players were able to exceed numbers that are beyond the stack limit (for example: 3162 Coal. The stack limit is 999). This is because it promised players that if they killed a player, their current loot in their inventory will bedoubled, and large amounts would not have enough inventory space to fill the entire ores, so they are forced tooverstackon each other.First Thumbnail (Duos)Second Thumbnail (Duos)Third Thumbnail (Duos)First Thumbnail (Squads)Second Thumbnail (Squads)Current Thumbnail
Explosives cannot destroy Beds in Bedwars and are only used to destroy the Blocks protecting the Bed.
You can prank your own teammates while Bridging. How to do this:
1. At the start of the game, buy Shears.  2.If one of your teammates starts making a bridge made out of Wool, use the Shears to mine the Wool below him. This can be very funny. It also works in Pirates. This troll, however, is totallynot recommended.
On July 26, 2024, Chests were added to the Bedwars squadsWesternmap, which previously didn't have anynormal ChestsorMoonstone Chests.
Some people don't like the new Bedwars thumbnail, and some don't care.
The Solos Mode was added again as a permanent game mode on October 18, 2024. The 4v4v4v4 mode renamed to "Squads" on the same day.
When your team’s Bed is destroyed, there is a sound effect of a Fireball explosion.

Note: These tips may give an unfair advantage to the player using it.
firstly farm coal (cracked bricks) then get started with this
If you know that your team is not good at the game, try this method below to try to gain a win.
Get a small amount of Wool.
Reach the back of your base.
Jump into the void, placing blocks on the edge in the process. You may have to do this multiple times.
If you want to, buy a Shear so you can destroy the enemies' bridges quickly.
Clutch using a block or ladder at the bottom of the pillar, then place a foothold so you don't fall to your death.
Bridge directly below your base and destroy your pillar and bridge, leaving only one block.
Seal yourself in a 1*2*1 area, and crouch to hide your nametag.
Wait until all other players leave the game and win.
If you can't find that one player who always hide in a top secret area, you can use the steps below in an attempt to find them.
Join the same lobby using an alternate account.
Locate the hidden player using your alternate account. Note that this process may take some time. To prevent your main account from being kicked for inactivity, move it every two to three minutes.
Once you managed to locate the hidden player, go to their hiding spot, and kill them.

Solosis aBedwarssub-gamemode. Unlike the originalBedwars, you only had one person per team, hence the name "solos". This was exactly the same asDuos, the same maps and such, but you had only yourself to trust. This is good for players who want "all the credit" or are just looking for a challenge. Note that if you want a single-player team just like Solos,Sky Warshas relatively the same mechanics. On October 18, 2024, this gamemode came back.

Players will spawn with aWoodenSwordand wearing coloredWoodenArmorrepresenting their Team color, both of which can be upgraded in the shop using four resources:Coal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamonds, in order of rarity and power. Players are divided into groups of one, two, three or four depending on whether it's a game of Solos, Duos, Trios, or Squads and have to protect theirBedwithBlocksfrom the shop, such as Wool, that can be bought with said materials.Soloswas removed in a gamemode vote against Squads, but was added back on Oct. 18, 2024. There are multiple phases of the game that allowMoonstoneandDiamondsto spawn faster and even causeBedsto be deleted (to speed the game up a little).
Because you can't get moonstone and diamonds on your own island, it is key that you either have a bridger to retrieve moonstone to get upgrades for the team and diamonds to give others diamond armor, or loyal players that don't hog resources and buy bricks and cover their bed with it. The bricks will take lots of time to break and that gives the team time to put up a defense without superior gear. Although the latter strat is defensive and can't really win games.
Each Team has their ownBedin the color of the Team. When an enemy breaks your Bed, you will still be alive, but after dying once, you will be lost and be put into spectator mode. You can't break your own team's Bed. Beds also don't blow up if you place a Moonstone Explosive on them, but they can otherwise be broken very easily, even with a fist. From 2:30 minutes after the game starts, The bed is aReinforced Bed, it is partially made out of Iron. Breaking it with a Pickaxe will be faster. After that, the Bed will turn in to aWood Bed.Breaking it by Axe will be faster. After breaking a Bed, there will be a muffled sound. When playing Solo, there will be 8 colors of Beds. There is an Upgrade available that makes your Bed permanently Reinforced for the length of 1 game.
AGeneratoris aBlockinBedwarsthat materials such asCoal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamondsspawn on top of.MoonstoneandDiamondgenerators get upgraded over time without payment of any type in phases such as "Moonstone 2" and "Diamond 3". When these upgrades reach their end, all Beds will be destroyed. There is also a warning in the chat saying 
“Beds destroyed. No more respawns!”.
Base Generators, the generators that spawn Coal and Iron, can be upgraded with Team Upgrades, which are paid for usingMoonstone. Upgrades cause generators to spawn their respective materials more often. The team upgrade "Generator III" causes diamonds to spawn in the Team generator as well.
Each Team has one generator in their base, which producesCoalandIron. 2Coalspawn approximately every second, and 2Iron BarsSpawn approximately every 20 seconds. The Generator can be upgraded usingMoonstone, then it will spawnCoalandIronfaster and even spawnDiamondsat upgrade Generator III.
These areMoonstoneandDiamond Blocks,respectively, placed on islands around the map. TheBlockscan't be mined. The map is symmetrical so all teams have the same distance to the generators. The generators upgrade over time and start producing faster.
The shop used to be accessed by pressing [B] while you are inside ANY base. Now however, one must click on an entity named “items” (has a blue skin) or an entity named “Upgrades” (black skin). The “Items” Mob has four sections: recommended,Blocks, Combat, and Utility. The “Upgrades” mob has only 1: Team upgrades. You can now also access Upgrades through the Shop Entity. When there are Lucky Items available, another section appears in the Shop just for them.
Lucky items are added once per 2 or more weeks. The most up to date ones are the Balloon [go up and drift slowly down] and the Launch Pad [launches anyone who steps on it straight to the middle island!]
When you die and respawn, you will lose all the Items you had in yourInventoryand hotbar. Upon respawning, you will lose your Items. However,Armoryou bought, as well asShears, Sword , Pickaxe, and Axewill not disappear when you respawn. You will also still be affected by the team upgrades. Swords, Pickaxes, and Axes will loose a tier when you respawn, from Diamond to Iron, Iron to Stone, and Stone to Wood.
There are twoChestsin every base. One is a Moonstone chest, and the other is a normal chest.
This chest, also known as a team chest, can be opened only by the team in whose base it is located. You can open this chest in your base and place items in it. Other members of your team will be able to take the items out, but opposing teams won't. When a whole team dies, everyone can open their team chest.
Thischestworks the same as the usualMoonstone Chest. Only you can access the items you put in it, and can use anyMoonstone Chestfrom any base, regardless if its your team or not. If you die, the items in yourMoonstone Chestwill still be there when you respawn. When you get a final kill, you will get all the items inside the playersMoonstone Chestthat you killed.
You can put only certain items into theMoonstone Chest. These areCoal,Iron Bars,Diamonds,Moonstone, and Blocks you bought at the shop, likeWool. You can't put utilities and weapons, such as swords, fireballs, etc., into theMoonstone Chest.
The NPC, better known as the "Seller" or the "Trader", is main access to the Shop. Its sell some items for the current match. Pressing the "B" key in range of the Seller will also open up its menu. There will be 2 sellers at every team-base. One seller sells blocks, food, combat weapons, and tools; and the other sells team upgrades for your team.
Scary Hollow is a map colored brown. Scary Hollow was the first map introduced toBedwars. Scary Hollow also introduced two newBlocks: Useless Soil and Magma. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to the neighboring base.
Roads is a map that is decorated with roads. TheMoonstoneislands are made into traffic cones. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
This map is of a bonsai forest. It is kind of like the Pagoda Map in Bedwars Trios & Squads. It usedAspenWoodPlanks, which were occasionally taken advantage of for hiding. The planks have since been replaced withPalmWoodplanks, introducing a new type ofWood.Concreteis placed as theLeavesof the big tree onDiamondIsland, which was also taken advantage of for hiding. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to any neighboring base.
Nuclear is a map taking place in an abandoned nuclear reactor. Be aware that there are holes in the center island, which you may fall through. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Pineis a large map where everything is situated between tall mountains. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Instead of the usual circular map, the map is now in a rectangular shape. TheDiamondandMoonstonelocations have been spread out across the map instead of being at the usual locations. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theDiamondisland and then to the base opposite yours. Also, take advantage of the tall buildings that can be used to hide orBlockclutches.
Solar is a map themed around the solar system. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly to the neighboring base and destroy their bed(s).
Wheat is a map with a farm motive. The bases are very near to the middle, so the best rushing strategy is to bridge to the middle and then to an enemy base. It's possible the enemies won't even have a Bed defense yet, allowing for the elimination of a team or two very quickly.
Wheat is a very unique map because the beds are separated from the main section of the base and at a lower level (x). You can go to the bed by going down the stairs connecting it with the main section of the base.
Extradia is an airport-themed map. It is one of the big Squads maps. The bases are very far apart so you can either bridge to the Moonstone islands or to the middle first and then over to the other bases. Note that this will take a long time and the enemies will have made a Bed defense by then.
Knaul is a smaller map; the bases are very near to the middle, allowing you to bridge to other base very quickly. You can either go over the Moonstone islands or over the middle in two other ways.
This map has a lot of obstacles and decorations, especially in the middle, meaning that it has a lot of good hiding spots.
Wide-and-Wild (a forest-themed map) is a bigger map; the middle is further away from the bases. However, the Moonstone islands aren't at all separated from the main one and are also slightly nearer to the bases, allowing you to bridge there first and then still access all the other parts of the middle.
Wasteland is a treasure-themed map. It used to be called "Western" It is a big Squads map. The bases are very far apart so it is easier to bridge to the middle first and then over to other bases.
Pagoda (a Japanese-themed map) is one of the smallest squads map, it is easier to bridge to the opponent's island. it is also the first map in Bedwars squads having 4 Diamond Spawners
Ahoy is a pirate themed map. Each base is actually a pirate ship.
Colosseum is a map that looks like ancient ruins. The map was released in Spring 2025. It is created byHarry.This includes Tai Chi spawners, and Diamond Spawners.
The map, again has been introduced by Harry. The map was built by some testers (unconfirmed if more than 1 player). This map includes the map almost like Wood Factory, with buildings and some cranes.
This map is introduced by Harry, on the date when the map Rooftop was added. This map introduces houses, with some village theme in the map.
Right-Hand Display during game
The Right-hand Display is the display that appears on the right of your screen. When you are not in a game and on the waiting screen, the statistics List will be shown. It includes your Wins, Kills, Final Kills (kills you got on a team whose Bed was gone) and Games Played. If you are in a game or viewing a game (via spectator mode), the Team Status will be shown. Every time you win aBedwarsgame, one win will be added to your Stats List. Every time you play aBedwarsgame, one game will be added to your stats list. The Team Status display shows the status of all the Teams. If a green tick or checkmark is shown, they still have theirBed. If a number is shown, they do not have theirBed, and the number shown is the number of players still alive. If a red cross or "X" is shown, it means the team is eliminated.

There is a way to hide so that no one can find you unless they use the tip above. Also, this is not recommended, as this is unfair play and requires good clutching skills.Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.Head to the back of the team base.Fall off and place the block downward.Repeat the first three steps multiple times.Repeat the first two steps one more time.Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.Stand on the singular block.Build a base around you.Crouch to hide your nametag.Wait.Win due to the other player giving up!Another way to win is by also buyingshears. When the enemy will try to get down to your base, mine the wool below him. Shears mine wool very quickly so the enemy will not have time to place a block or clutch.
Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.
Head to the back of the team base.
Fall off and place the block downward.
Repeat the first three steps multiple times.
Repeat the first two steps one more time.
Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.
Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.
Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.
Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.
Stand on the singular block.
Build a base around you.
Crouch to hide your nametag.
Wait.
Win due to the other player giving up!
Another way to win is by also buyingshears. When the enemy will try to get down to your base, mine the wool below him. Shears mine wool very quickly so the enemy will not have time to place a block or clutch.
If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go fullscreen" or the F11 key. Another way is to crouch with C, the other Ctrl, or any other key you assigned to crouching in the keybinds settings.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the bed. Try to be sneaky.
If the game has been going on for quite a while, you should, before attacking other bases, prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and aStick. After breaking their bed, try hitting the players with the stick if they are near the edge.
You can also rush quickly after the start of a game if your sweaty or good. A goodpickaxe(or explosive),PvPskills, and blocking skills are required. This strategy yields many more wins but is dangerous if your teammates aren't good or if no one protects your bed.
If you fall off and die in early-game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can increase your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
There is another unfair way to play, although it doesn't work anymore. Set the vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothing. This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunks at null.
Remember to crouch when hiding.
When looking to escape from other players, an option is to buy wool and pillar to maximum build height, optionally breaking blocks underneath with shears. However, this technique can be countered using ladders, bows, fireballs, or golden watermelon slices.
Pillar up to about y = 100, then slowly bridge until you are directly above someone's Bed. drop a large number of Moonstone Explosive, or jump down, destroy it, and return to your bridge immediately by pillaring.
The game description has an error in it. It states, "Destroy your enemies beds to win!" but the word "enemies" should be "enemies'’" with an apostrophe, to make it "Destroy your enemies' beds to win!".
There are now Cobwebs orGlassin the corners of many maps, which makes it more annoying toPvP.
You can now create your own custom bedwars game/map in Creative mode and than put it in Bedwars.
Bedwars was called "Bed Wars" before.
Duos used to be a sub-gamemode of Bedwars.
Both Bedwars Duos and Bedwars squads changed thumbnails on 7/19/2024. Plots also changed its thumbnail on the same day.
When a map has a Risky Buissness modifier, players were able to exceed numbers that are beyond the stack limit (for example: 3162 Coal. The stack limit is 999). This is because it promised players that if they killed a player, their current loot in their inventory will bedoubled, and large amounts would not have enough inventory space to fill the entire ores, so they are forced tooverstackon each other.First Thumbnail (Duos)Second Thumbnail (Duos)Third Thumbnail (Duos)First Thumbnail (Squads)Second Thumbnail (Squads)Current Thumbnail
Explosives cannot destroy Beds in Bedwars and are only used to destroy the Blocks protecting the Bed.
You can prank your own teammates while Bridging. How to do this:
1. At the start of the game, buy Shears.  2.If one of your teammates starts making a bridge made out of Wool, use the Shears to mine the Wool below him. This can be very funny. It also works in Pirates. This troll, however, is totallynot recommended.
On July 26, 2024, Chests were added to the Bedwars squadsWesternmap, which previously didn't have anynormal ChestsorMoonstone Chests.
Some people don't like the new Bedwars thumbnail, and some don't care.
The Solos Mode was added again as a permanent game mode on October 18, 2024. The 4v4v4v4 mode renamed to "Squads" on the same day.
When your team’s Bed is destroyed, there is a sound effect of a Fireball explosion.

Bedwarsis a teamworkPvPGame Mode. It was first seen instaging.bloxd.iobut was then moved toBloxd.io. You battle your opponents on islands floating in the sky. Protect yourBedand try to break your opponents’Bedto prevent them from respawning in order to win. You must kill all the opponents without them respawning to win the game. Even if your team wins, you will not technically win according to your stats list if you permanently die before they win. If you accidently fall into the void, you can save yourself by placing towers in the void. This trick can also be useful if you are losing; you could jump into the void on purpose and save yourself by placing towers in the void (this will make you survive longer).

AGeneratoris aBlockinBedwarsthat materials such asCoal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamondsspawn on top of.MoonstoneandDiamondgenerators get upgraded over time without payment of any type in phases such as "Moonstone 2" and "Diamond 3". When these upgrades reach their end, all Beds will be destroyed. There is also a warning in the chat saying 
“Beds destroyed. No more respawns!”.
Base Generators, the generators that spawn Coal and Iron, can be upgraded with Team Upgrades, which are paid for usingMoonstone. Upgrades cause generators to spawn their respective materials more often. The team upgrade "Generator III" causes diamonds to spawn in the Team generator as well.
Each Team has one generator in their base, which producesCoalandIron. 2Coalspawn approximately every second, and 2Iron BarsSpawn approximately every 20 seconds. The Generator can be upgraded usingMoonstone, then it will spawnCoalandIronfaster and even spawnDiamondsat upgrade Generator III.
These areMoonstoneandDiamond Blocks,respectively, placed on islands around the map. TheBlockscan't be mined. The map is symmetrical so all teams have the same distance to the generators. The generators upgrade over time and start producing faster.
The shop used to be accessed by pressing [B] while you are inside ANY base. Now however, one must click on an entity named “items” (has a blue skin) or an entity named “Upgrades” (black skin). The “Items” Mob has four sections: recommended,Blocks, Combat, and Utility. The “Upgrades” mob has only 1: Team upgrades. You can now also access Upgrades through the Shop Entity. When there are Lucky Items available, another section appears in the Shop just for them.
Lucky items are added once per 2 or more weeks. The most up to date ones are the Balloon [go up and drift slowly down] and the Launch Pad [launches anyone who steps on it straight to the middle island!]
When you die and respawn, you will lose all the Items you had in yourInventoryand hotbar. Upon respawning, you will lose your Items. However,Armoryou bought, as well asShears, Sword , Pickaxe, and Axewill not disappear when you respawn. You will also still be affected by the team upgrades. Swords, Pickaxes, and Axes will loose a tier when you respawn, from Diamond to Iron, Iron to Stone, and Stone to Wood.
There are twoChestsin every base. One is a Moonstone chest, and the other is a normal chest.
This chest, also known as a team chest, can be opened only by the team in whose base it is located. You can open this chest in your base and place items in it. Other members of your team will be able to take the items out, but opposing teams won't. When a whole team dies, everyone can open their team chest.
Thischestworks the same as the usualMoonstone Chest. Only you can access the items you put in it, and can use anyMoonstone Chestfrom any base, regardless if its your team or not. If you die, the items in yourMoonstone Chestwill still be there when you respawn. When you get a final kill, you will get all the items inside the playersMoonstone Chestthat you killed.
You can put only certain items into theMoonstone Chest. These areCoal,Iron Bars,Diamonds,Moonstone, and Blocks you bought at the shop, likeWool. You can't put utilities and weapons, such as swords, fireballs, etc., into theMoonstone Chest.
The NPC, better known as the "Seller" or the "Trader", is main access to the Shop. Its sell some items for the current match. Pressing the "B" key in range of the Seller will also open up its menu. There will be 2 sellers at every team-base. One seller sells blocks, food, combat weapons, and tools; and the other sells team upgrades for your team.
Scary Hollow is a map colored brown. Scary Hollow was the first map introduced toBedwars. Scary Hollow also introduced two newBlocks: Useless Soil and Magma. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to the neighboring base.
Roads is a map that is decorated with roads. TheMoonstoneislands are made into traffic cones. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
This map is of a bonsai forest. It is kind of like the Pagoda Map in Bedwars Trios & Squads. It usedAspenWoodPlanks, which were occasionally taken advantage of for hiding. The planks have since been replaced withPalmWoodplanks, introducing a new type ofWood.Concreteis placed as theLeavesof the big tree onDiamondIsland, which was also taken advantage of for hiding. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to any neighboring base.
Nuclear is a map taking place in an abandoned nuclear reactor. Be aware that there are holes in the center island, which you may fall through. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Pineis a large map where everything is situated between tall mountains. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly from your base to theMoonstoneisland and then to the neighboring base.
Instead of the usual circular map, the map is now in a rectangular shape. TheDiamondandMoonstonelocations have been spread out across the map instead of being at the usual locations. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge to theDiamondisland and then to the base opposite yours. Also, take advantage of the tall buildings that can be used to hide orBlockclutches.
Solar is a map themed around the solar system. The most dominant early-game rushing strategy is to bridge directly to the neighboring base and destroy their bed(s).
Wheat is a map with a farm motive. The bases are very near to the middle, so the best rushing strategy is to bridge to the middle and then to an enemy base. It's possible the enemies won't even have a Bed defense yet, allowing for the elimination of a team or two very quickly.
Wheat is a very unique map because the beds are separated from the main section of the base and at a lower level (x). You can go to the bed by going down the stairs connecting it with the main section of the base.
Extradia is an airport-themed map. It is one of the big Squads maps. The bases are very far apart so you can either bridge to the Moonstone islands or to the middle first and then over to the other bases. Note that this will take a long time and the enemies will have made a Bed defense by then.
Knaul is a smaller map; the bases are very near to the middle, allowing you to bridge to other base very quickly. You can either go over the Moonstone islands or over the middle in two other ways.
This map has a lot of obstacles and decorations, especially in the middle, meaning that it has a lot of good hiding spots.
Wide-and-Wild (a forest-themed map) is a bigger map; the middle is further away from the bases. However, the Moonstone islands aren't at all separated from the main one and are also slightly nearer to the bases, allowing you to bridge there first and then still access all the other parts of the middle.
Wasteland is a treasure-themed map. It used to be called "Western" It is a big Squads map. The bases are very far apart so it is easier to bridge to the middle first and then over to other bases.
Pagoda (a Japanese-themed map) is one of the smallest squads map, it is easier to bridge to the opponent's island. it is also the first map in Bedwars squads having 4 Diamond Spawners
Ahoy is a pirate themed map. Each base is actually a pirate ship.
Colosseum is a map that looks like ancient ruins. The map was released in Spring 2025. It is created byHarry.This includes Tai Chi spawners, and Diamond Spawners.
The map, again has been introduced by Harry. The map was built by some testers (unconfirmed if more than 1 player). This map includes the map almost like Wood Factory, with buildings and some cranes.
This map is introduced by Harry, on the date when the map Rooftop was added. This map introduces houses, with some village theme in the map.
Right-Hand Display during game
The Right-hand Display is the display that appears on the right of your screen. When you are not in a game and on the waiting screen, the statistics List will be shown. It includes your Wins, Kills, Final Kills (kills you got on a team whose Bed was gone) and Games Played. If you are in a game or viewing a game (via spectator mode), the Team Status will be shown. Every time you win aBedwarsgame, one win will be added to your Stats List. Every time you play aBedwarsgame, one game will be added to your stats list. The Team Status display shows the status of all the Teams. If a green tick or checkmark is shown, they still have theirBed. If a number is shown, they do not have theirBed, and the number shown is the number of players still alive. If a red cross or "X" is shown, it means the team is eliminated.

There is a way to hide so that no one can find you unless they use the tip above. Also, this is not recommended, as this is unfair play and requires good clutching skills.Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.Head to the back of the team base.Fall off and place the block downward.Repeat the first three steps multiple times.Repeat the first two steps one more time.Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.Stand on the singular block.Build a base around you.Crouch to hide your nametag.Wait.Win due to the other player giving up!Another way to win is by also buyingshears. When the enemy will try to get down to your base, mine the wool below him. Shears mine wool very quickly so the enemy will not have time to place a block or clutch.
Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.
Head to the back of the team base.
Fall off and place the block downward.
Repeat the first three steps multiple times.
Repeat the first two steps one more time.
Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.
Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.
Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.
Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.
Stand on the singular block.
Build a base around you.
Crouch to hide your nametag.
Wait.
Win due to the other player giving up!
Another way to win is by also buyingshears. When the enemy will try to get down to your base, mine the wool below him. Shears mine wool very quickly so the enemy will not have time to place a block or clutch.
If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go fullscreen" or the F11 key. Another way is to crouch with C, the other Ctrl, or any other key you assigned to crouching in the keybinds settings.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the bed. Try to be sneaky.
If the game has been going on for quite a while, you should, before attacking other bases, prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and aStick. After breaking their bed, try hitting the players with the stick if they are near the edge.
You can also rush quickly after the start of a game if your sweaty or good. A goodpickaxe(or explosive),PvPskills, and blocking skills are required. This strategy yields many more wins but is dangerous if your teammates aren't good or if no one protects your bed.
If you fall off and die in early-game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can increase your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
There is another unfair way to play, although it doesn't work anymore. Set the vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothing. This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunks at null.
Remember to crouch when hiding.
When looking to escape from other players, an option is to buy wool and pillar to maximum build height, optionally breaking blocks underneath with shears. However, this technique can be countered using ladders, bows, fireballs, or golden watermelon slices.
Pillar up to about y = 100, then slowly bridge until you are directly above someone's Bed. drop a large number of Moonstone Explosive, or jump down, destroy it, and return to your bridge immediately by pillaring.
The game description has an error in it. It states, "Destroy your enemies beds to win!" but the word "enemies" should be "enemies'’" with an apostrophe, to make it "Destroy your enemies' beds to win!".
There are now Cobwebs orGlassin the corners of many maps, which makes it more annoying toPvP.
You can now create your own custom bedwars game/map in Creative mode and than put it in Bedwars.
Bedwars was called "Bed Wars" before.
Duos used to be a sub-gamemode of Bedwars.
Both Bedwars Duos and Bedwars squads changed thumbnails on 7/19/2024. Plots also changed its thumbnail on the same day.
When a map has a Risky Buissness modifier, players were able to exceed numbers that are beyond the stack limit (for example: 3162 Coal. The stack limit is 999). This is because it promised players that if they killed a player, their current loot in their inventory will bedoubled, and large amounts would not have enough inventory space to fill the entire ores, so they are forced tooverstackon each other.First Thumbnail (Duos)Second Thumbnail (Duos)Third Thumbnail (Duos)First Thumbnail (Squads)Second Thumbnail (Squads)Current Thumbnail
Explosives cannot destroy Beds in Bedwars and are only used to destroy the Blocks protecting the Bed.
You can prank your own teammates while Bridging. How to do this:
1. At the start of the game, buy Shears.  2.If one of your teammates starts making a bridge made out of Wool, use the Shears to mine the Wool below him. This can be very funny. It also works in Pirates. This troll, however, is totallynot recommended.
On July 26, 2024, Chests were added to the Bedwars squadsWesternmap, which previously didn't have anynormal ChestsorMoonstone Chests.
Some people don't like the new Bedwars thumbnail, and some don't care.
The Solos Mode was added again as a permanent game mode on October 18, 2024. The 4v4v4v4 mode renamed to "Squads" on the same day.
When your team’s Bed is destroyed, there is a sound effect of a Fireball explosion.

Bedwarsis a teamworkPvPGame Mode. It was first seen instaging.bloxd.iobut was then moved toBloxd.io. You battle your opponents on islands floating in the sky. Protect yourBedand try to break your opponents’Bedto prevent them from respawning in order to win. You must kill all the opponents without them respawning to win the game. Even if your team wins, you will not technically win according to your stats list if you permanently die before they win. If you accidently fall into the void, you can save yourself by placing towers in the void. This trick can also be useful if you are losing; you could jump into the void on purpose and save yourself by placing towers in the void (this will make you survive longer).

DiamondIsland, also known asMid,which is shorthand forMiddle, is in the center of most maps inBed Wars, and it hasDiamondgenerators. In Wood Factory, a Duos map (see below), there are fourDiamondislands, each with its ownDiamondgenerator.
The moonstone islands are used for spawning moonstones, hence the name. you can bridge easily to an enemy base inSquads/Triosgame mode. inSolos/Duos, however, you can't use the moonstone islands to bridge to the enemy base, because in squads/trios, the islands arebetween the bases, but in solos/duos, the islands arenext to the mid, so that means you can't do it in duos/solos.
Changed map names.
NPC (or seller) added.
Discount on some Items (eg Fireball), and increased price of some Items (eg Moonstone Explosive).
Lucky Items added.
Fall Damage added.
Sometimes if you kill a player, there will be a sound like a a swish.
If you get a final kill, there will be a sound like a sack crashing to the ground.
if your bed gets destroyed, there will be afireballsound.
if you break an enemy bed, then there will be a muffled sound.

Bedwars SolosInfoDescriptionDestroy your enemies beds to win! Play without teammatesDeveloperArthurScript Namebedwars_solo
Solosis aBedwarssub-gamemode. Unlike the originalBedwars, you only had one person per team, hence the name "solos". This was exactly the same asDuos, the same maps and such, but you had only yourself to trust. This is good for players who want "all the credit" or are just looking for a challenge. Note that if you want a single-player team just like Solos,Sky Warshas relatively the same mechanics. On October 18, 2024, this gamemode came back.

Players will spawn with aWoodenSwordand wearing coloredWoodenArmorrepresenting their Team color, both of which can be upgraded in the shop using four resources:Coal,Iron,Moonstone, andDiamonds, in order of rarity and power. Players are divided into groups of one, two, three or four depending on whether it's a game of Solos, Duos, Trios, or Squads and have to protect theirBedwithBlocksfrom the shop, such as Wool, that can be bought with said materials.Soloswas removed in a gamemode vote against Squads, but was added back on Oct. 18, 2024. There are multiple phases of the game that allowMoonstoneandDiamondsto spawn faster and even causeBedsto be deleted (to speed the game up a little).
Because you can't get moonstone and diamonds on your own island, it is key that you either have a bridger to retrieve moonstone to get upgrades for the team and diamonds to give others diamond armor, or loyal players that don't hog resources and buy bricks and cover their bed with it. The bricks will take lots of time to break and that gives the team time to put up a defense without superior gear. Although the latter strat is defensive and can't really win games.
Each Team has their ownBedin the color of the Team. When an enemy breaks your Bed, you will still be alive, but after dying once, you will be lost and be put into spectator mode. You can't break your own team's Bed. Beds also don't blow up if you place a Moonstone Explosive on them, but they can otherwise be broken very easily, even with a fist. From 2:30 minutes after the game starts, The bed is aReinforced Bed, it is partially made out of Iron. Breaking it with a Pickaxe will be faster. After that, the Bed will turn in to aWood Bed.Breaking it by Axe will be faster. After breaking a Bed, there will be a muffled sound. When playing Solo, there will be 8 colors of Beds. There is an Upgrade available that makes your Bed permanently Reinforced for the length of 1 game.

It includes your Wins, Kills, Final Kills (kills you got on a team whose Bed was gone) and Games Played. If you are in a game or viewing a game (via spectator mode), the Team Status will be shown. Every time you win aBedwarsgame, one win will be added to your Stats List. Every time you play aBedwarsgame, one game will be added to your stats list. The Team Status display shows the status of all the Teams. If a green tick or checkmark is shown, they still have theirBed. If a number is shown, they do not have theirBed, and the number shown is the number of players still alive. If a red cross or "X" is shown, it means the team is eliminated.

There is a way to hide so that no one can find you unless they use the tip above. Also, this is not recommended, as this is unfair play and requires good clutching skills.Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.Head to the back of the team base.Fall off and place the block downward.Repeat the first three steps multiple times.Repeat the first two steps one more time.Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.Stand on the singular block.Build a base around you.Crouch to hide your nametag.Wait.Win due to the other player giving up!Another way to win is by also buyingshears.

Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.
Head to the back of the team base.
Fall off and place the block downward.
Repeat the first three steps multiple times.
Repeat the first two steps one more time.
Place a block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.
Jump onto the block; you should be one block from hitting the ceiling with your head.
Place blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.
Destroy the previously placed blocks except the pillar and the blocks below the base.
Stand on the singular block.
Build a base around you.
Crouch to hide your nametag.
Wait.
Win due to the other player giving up!
Another way to win is by also buyingshears. When the enemy will try to get down to your base, mine the wool below him. Shears mine wool very quickly so the enemy will not have time to place a block or clutch.
If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go fullscreen" or the F11 key. Another way is to crouch with C, the other Ctrl, or any other key you assigned to crouching in the keybinds settings.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the bed. Try to be sneaky.
If the game has been going on for quite a while, you should, before attacking other bases, prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and aStick. After breaking their bed, try hitting the players with the stick if they are near the edge.
You can also rush quickly after the start of a game if your sweaty or good. A goodpickaxe(or explosive),PvPskills, and blocking skills are required. This strategy yields many more wins but is dangerous if your teammates aren't good or if no one protects your bed.
If you fall off and die in early-game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can increase your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
There is another unfair way to play, although it doesn't work anymore. Set the vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothing. This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunks at null.
Remember to crouch when hiding.
When looking to escape from other players, an option is to buy wool and pillar to maximum build height, optionally breaking blocks underneath with shears. However, this technique can be countered using ladders, bows, fireballs, or golden watermelon slices.
Pillar up to about y = 100, then slowly bridge until you are directly above someone's Bed. drop a large number of Moonstone Explosive, or jump down, destroy it, and return to your bridge immediately by pillaring.
The game description has an error in it. It states, "Destroy your enemies beds to win!" but the word "enemies" should be "enemies'’" with an apostrophe, to make it "Destroy your enemies' beds to win!".
There are now Cobwebs orGlassin the corners of many maps, which makes it more annoying toPvP.
You can now create your own custom bedwars game/map in Creative mode and than put it in Bedwars.
Bedwars was called "Bed Wars" before.
Duos used to be a sub-gamemode of Bedwars.
Both Bedwars Duos and Bedwars squads changed thumbnails on 7/19/2024. Plots also changed its thumbnail on the same day.
When a map has a Risky Buissness modifier, players were able to exceed numbers that are beyond the stack limit (for example: 3162 Coal. The stack limit is 999). This is because it promised players that if they killed a player, their current loot in their inventory will bedoubled, and large amounts would not have enough inventory space to fill the entire ores, so they are forced tooverstackon each other.First Thumbnail (Duos)Second Thumbnail (Duos)Third Thumbnail (Duos)First Thumbnail (Squads)Second Thumbnail (Squads)Current Thumbnail
Explosives cannot destroy Beds in Bedwars and are only used to destroy the Blocks protecting the Bed.
You can prank your own teammates while Bridging. How to do this:
1. At the start of the game, buy Shears.  2.If one of your teammates starts making a bridge made out of Wool, use the Shears to mine the Wool below him. This can be very funny. It also works in Pirates. This troll, however, is totallynot recommended.
On July 26, 2024, Chests were added to the Bedwars squadsWesternmap, which previously didn't have anynormal ChestsorMoonstone Chests.
Some people don't like the new Bedwars thumbnail, and some don't care.
The Solos Mode was added again as a permanent game mode on October 18, 2024. The 4v4v4v4 mode renamed to "Squads" on the same day.
When your team’s Bed is destroyed, there is a sound effect of a Fireball explosion.

The Players start the game on a floating island with up to eight other teams. Each team can only have one player. There is a giant Gold and black cube at the center, with the 9 Items that players have to obtain displayed on it. The Items are chosen randomly from some of the obtainable Items in Survival. Every time a team obtains an Item, the cube will change the background of that Item for that team. The game lasts for a maximum of 15 minutes. If you obtain an Item required for the hunt , you get 1⭐, if you get all the Items in a horizontal line or vertical line as represented on the cube (three in a row), you will receive an additional 5 ⭐.PVPis enabled, so the players must also watch their backs to avoid others stealing their Items and points. Teleportation in any means other than going to spawn is disabled (no setting Homes and no teleport requests). Homes have been disabled so players can't use them tox-ray. You can teleport back to spawn by right-clicking while holding the Compass.
The game ends in either of the following circumstances:
A player collects all Items and wins.
Time runs out and the player with the most ⭐ wins.
All other players leave the game and the remaining player wins.

When the game starts, it is best to look at the cube first before jumping down to the open world. This is because the icons of the Items shown at the right side of your screen are tiny, and cannot be easily identified. Looking at the cube first helps to clarify which Items you are looking for. You can also write the Items down, especially similar ones like logs. After jumping down to the open world, it is best to look for the more common Items first, as the game only lasts for 20 minutes. Going intoCreativemight also help, as these two modes share the same seeds, so you should scout for Items! Since PVP is enabled, you can get the Items AND the points of your opponent if you killed them and stole their Items. Another good idea is to split the work with your teammate, one staying on the surface to collect Plants/Logs while the other going underground to mine.
If you have played on a specificSurvival/Peacefulgamemode server for a long time, we suggest to play the Bingo server with the same number as yourSurvival/Peacefulserver as terrain generation is similar.
Bingo was first added onStagingon 29th May, and added to bloxd.io on May 31, 2024.
The floating island is actually not directly above spawn. Instead, it is about 20 Blocks away from the Northeast side of spawn.
Bingo has the same seed generation as otherOpen World lobbieswho share the same number code/seed.
The cube shows the team that has obtained certain blocks.
This is the only gamemode where spectators can (somewhat) break blocks.
The Blocks on the cube at spawn are all turned upside down. This isn't so for Tools and other Items.
No one knows why the Bingo game mode was removed from the game on June 7, 2024 along withWalls.
Every item on the board in the thumbnail is in the item list.
When it was re-added, it was a Limited Time Mode but not going against another gamemode. It is unknown what the reason for this is.The announcement of Bingo in the update log.The update log said that it was back as Solos, but it is clearly not, as the games show.
The announcement of Bingo in the update log.
If you get a “Block of (mineral), go to the Frozen Badlands ruins and try to mine whatever is inside the graves.
The new thumbnail of Bingo has a string on the 8th square, which isn’t even released to the public yet.
Players used to not be able to score line bonuses.
The game used to last for 25 minutes instead of 20.
There used to be eight teams of one instead of four of two players. Even though there were eight teams, the option to join team Cyan and Gray was nonexistent. When the game starts the two players from those teams would be merged with another two teams, exulting in those two teams having more than the maximum amount of players, which was one per team.
Some say that when the game was first released, theHang Gliderwas made ofWood, notIron. They say that the Wood Hang Glider got replaced after a few minutes after the release of thegame mode.
Previously, you needed to collect 25 items to complete the game. After it was added back, you only need 9 items.

Bloxd.iois a sandbox game created by Arthur and Weiqing . Bloxd.io was once a small parkour game called BloxdHop, but with the addition of many different game modes, it became a thriving community of players joining and having fun together. The three "gods of the game" as VOID, a dangerous entity inCreativeandSurvivalLobby -1, are Weiqing, Arthur, and Mattzap. Stardue and Dirty Flea Sack were two other developers who helped make game modes and items likebooksand the game modes likePirates. Pixelbaker and Slushie were the other two developers who helped in making new updates forBedwars.
Bloxd.io started as a small parkour game calledBloxdHop.EvilTowerwas then added, and thenDoodleCubeand a beta version ofCubeWarfarewas added. These game modes are referred to as the original four. However, all these gamemodes had one goal: to win the event or game. So, the next game mode added wasPeaceful, a game mode where you can hang out with other players and just have fun. What's that? People want a more competitive game mode? Ah, there couldn't have been a better time to addSurvival, a game mode where people can kill each other and craft weapons. Players could build amazing structures withCreativeand make their own world with theWorldsgamemode. Many more game modes are also in existence likeBedwarsandMurder Mystery, and they are just as fun.
Later, they even renamed some of the gamemodes! BloxdHop changed to Bloxd hop, EvilTower changed to Evil Tower, DoodleCube to Doodle Cube, CubeWarfare to Cube Warfare, Skywars to Sky Wars, and so on.
Bloxd.io is similar toMinecraft, but has different updates. There are many differences to Minecraft, like eating fruits to gain effects and naming different types of things. However, Bloxd.io is still fun, and some people even think that Bloxd.io is better! Bloxd.io is a free online game, while Minecraft costs money to play as an app (which can be kind of annoying). Bloxd.io can be found and played onhttps://bloxd.io,Crazygames, and Discord's Activity Launcher.
Some gamemodes in Bloxd.io are DOWNRIGHT similar to Minecraft. For example, One Block in Bloxd.io is actually pretty similar to Skyblock in Minecraft, and so does Creative and Bedwars.
Bloxd.io was once a small parkour game. All skins were identical, looking surprised basic avatars. There was only 3 gamemodes:DoodleCube,EvilTower, andBloxdHop. There was also a play button, where you would select the gamemode you wanted to play and then press play. There was noSurvival,Peaceful,Creative, orWorlds, at that time. The only items you could have in your inventory was aBlocker, obtained in BloxdHop. You could copy other player's names, but if you joined the same lobby, one name would have a 1 at the end. Many players were bots, however, there was no default names, like Audacity283719502 , JuicyEyeball02913801,  ElegantBadger5743861, etc.

A new game mode,Worlds, was added soon. You could make your own world and own it! Being the owner gives you many benefits. You are allowed to kick and ban players, change yours and other people's Game Mode, and more! An update was also given to the game, addingGlass,Doors, Trapdoors, Water Buckets,Protectors, and Fat Cacti. Protectors would protect a 32 x 96 x 32 Chunk where other people can not break Blocks, place Blocks, or open Chests.
Survivalwas then added. It was a big hit because public lobbies until then could only be peaceful. Swords cannot be crafted in peaceful, but they can be crafted in Survival! Swords deal the most damage of all the tools craft-able, and a Diamond Sword can three-hit a player with no Armour, even to the present day.
After these four game modes, the next one was a big hit.Peaceful, similar to Minecraft, is a game mode withoutWeapons. Players had access toBlocks,Tools, caves,Ores, and more, in a persistent open world. It became unpopular after Survival was created.
Creativewas added for building amazing structures! You had access to nearly all Blocks and Items in the game. Additionally, everyone can fly in Creative as much as they want. First, Protectors had to be crafted with Diamonds, but thenArthuradded a system where when you placed or broke enough Blocks, you obtained a Protector from the Creative Inventory.
InPeaceful, the Artisan bench was added, allowing you to make Dyed Planks and other decorative Blocks. This started the chaos in Bloxd, causing many professional builders to still playPeacefulto this day.
Mattzapthen created two gamemodes and made people vote on the one they wanted.
The first one wasOne Blockwhere you spawned on one Block. If you mine the Block, another one spawns in its place. Collect a lot of Blocks and build your island. There were only a few Blocks the One Block gave you (Dirt,Grass Block, Maple Log, Clay, Ores).Coal Oredropped itself as if you mined it with a Moonstone Pickaxe and had to be mined again later to obtain Coal. This was a good start for One Block.
Greenvillewas the second gamemode thatMattzappmade. You would work for a living. First you would select a House. Then you would go to the town square to work. At the Market, you must mine the Blocks the shop tells you to mine. At the Demolition site you must break Blocks. As you kept playing, you would earn more money to buy new Blocks and edit your House or buy new Houses.
Out of these two gamemodes,Greenvillewas the winner.One Block, who was the loser, was removed (for now) from the game to enter a new gamemode vote later on.
TheIron Watermelonwas an entity. It was added byArthurin summer 2022. It was used to jump-scare players not to go over 6000 Blocks out of spawn, since world generation wasn't perfected back then.
Arthur and Mattzapp made two new gamemodes, so one was removed.
One Block was the same thing. However, Bedwars, the second gamemode in the gamemode vote won against One Block and was added. It's a lot like Minecraft (Hypixel) Bedwars. You would spawn on your own island with a Bed, going against 8 teams. You must protect your Bed with different Blocks and Items from the shop. If you broke another team’s Bed, the team who owned that Bed could not respawn anymore. The last person standing wins! Tools could also help you break Beds, and Weapons helped you kill players quickly. The valuables you could get were Coal, Iron, Gold, and Diamond. Coal let you get Blocks and basic Tools, Iron helped you upgrade Tools, get Armor, and get better Blocks.

A newBiome, Snowy Plains, was added.Icespawns on rivers in this Biome. Running on Ice is 1.4 times faster.
Combat logging was added for the first time. Back then, you were killed if you left the Lobby with less than 50 HP and were hit within the previous 10 seconds.
Sandstone Bricks.
Engraved Diorite, Andesite, and Granite, Bricks made out of these three Stone variants.
Moonstone Pickaxe.
Ice Bricks.
NewForest Biomescontaining new Tree and Wood types: Aspen, Pine, Cedar, Elm, Palm, and Plum.
Red Desert and Cactus Desert Biomes added.
You can now enable PvP and Parkour in your House inGreenville.
Empty Plot and Parkour Plot Houses added to Greenville.
You can't use teleport if damaged within the previous 10 seconds.
Maximum Chunk Load Distance was increased to 10.
Better to request with improved UI and shortcut keys to accept or deny.
You can no longer accept TP requests and set Homes while in combat or while dead.
You don't get killed if you combat log due to the server restarting.
The world's browser was improved.
If you aren't logged in, you can now only use the normal characters a-z, A-Z, numbers 0-9, and underscore _ in your player name. Soon, also logged-in players had this limitation. With this, it's easier to teleport to players, ban or kick them, report them, and harder to impersonate people or avoid the swear filter.
Bug fixes
A Rejoin Lobby button was added for Open-World game modes, so you can now rejoin the last lobbies you played in, even if you forget the name.
One Block andMurder Mysterywere added as Limited Time Game Modes in a competition.
Descriptions were added to someBlocksand Items; hover over the Item in your Inventory to see the Description.
One Block islands now save per lobby.
Two newBedwarsMaps!
Autumn ForestBiome.
Rocky Dirtis found on Mountains.
One Block won against Murder Mystery.
Fallen Maple Leaves added as the first Slab.
MoreSlabs.
Rocky Dirt is now craftable.
Messy Dirt.
Andesite, Diorite, and Granitecan now be used for recipes with Stone, like Stone Tools and Furnaces.
You can now rotate Furnaces, Chests, and Moonstone Chests.
You can now see older messages you posted in Chat.
Cactinow grow on Sand.
Plum Trees drop Plums and Palm Trees drop Coconuts. Throw a Coconut at the ground to create a Cracked Coconut.Plum gives you +50% Damage for 8 seconds while Cracked Coconut gives you +30% Speed for 8 seconds.
Plum and Coconut Blocks.
Critical hits now deal +20% Damage and not 50%.
Plums and Coconuts receive their Descriptions.
Plums for 2 Diamonds and Cracked Coconuts for 1 Diamond have been added toBedwars.
Now you only get 4 Obsidian instead of 8 for 4 Diamonds in Bedwars.
The press to get the war period is the period when people discovered the press to getthe Boards.Fireballs, Iceballs, andMoonstone Explosiveswere also added. Servers about these are flooding the browser page.
Disclaimer: The name of this period is unofficial; it is named by a lot of players from observation.
Around the same time as the Press to Get war period, when Fireballs, Iceballs, andMoonstone Explosiveswere introduced, these 3 Items were added to Bedwars, changing the play style and ruining fort building.
We have reached mid-2023. This gamemode vote was betweenSky WarsandPrison, which are both created byStardue. They both have their pros and cons, but Sky Wars won. This caused the fall ofBedwars.
The Food update was here, and it introduced 3 new, wildly spawned crops: Pumpkins, Watermelons, and Melons. Pumpkins were really OP for a few days because of Pumpkin Pies giving a WHOLE minute of damage boost. However, this changed after a few days.
The Iron Watermelon was also added to the game, becoming one of the rarest Items.
The second part of the Food update didn't introduce any new Fruits, but it added a mechanic - Food Eating Time. Now, food cannot be eaten in a click, but you have to hold the RMB to eat. It made Pumpkin Pie's eating time VERY long. Food eat time was added due to a mechanic people would use called "bread spam" or "food spam," involving one-click-to-eat Food and quickly switching back to their main weapon. Bread and other Foods spam unbalanced PvP.
This update also balanced the stats of Foods. Poor Pumpkin Pies took so long to eat! This made Gold Melon Slices become the best food, being capable of healing over 36 hp while having a relatively fast eating time of 0.5 seconds, estimated.
Potionswere added to the game. At first, there were only three (four, counting Water Bottles) Potions: Damage (Plums), Speed (Coconuts), and Defense (Pears). Then, more and more Potions were added, while Splash Potions and level II Potions were introduced to the game. This also made Sky Wars get a lot more Kits.
This was a small update, only adding one Item: theCompass. It was designed byStardueto prevent players inSky Warsfrom hiding. It isn't that OP in survival, so that's why it is a smaller update. Little did everyone know, this would have another use in 2024.
Yet ANOTHERgamemode votehappened, and this time,Prisonis back with a slight rework. However,Plotswere welcomed by the community with their super-flat design. Yet again, Prison miserably lost. Followed by this, 2023 had ended.

To kick off the start of the year, on 3 January 2024, several new perks were introduced to Sky Wars bystardue.
On 4 January, 2024,Prisonlost a second gamemode vote, this time toPlots. Based on the tone of the message delivered, the gamemode is likely to never return again.
The day after after the previous gamemode vote, on January 5, 2024, Pirates is back after being out only for 16 hours in the previous year and Survival Royale being a remix of the Hunger Games and Fortnite. Survival Royale, however, was poorly designed and had many bugs.
On January 8, 2024, Arthur made it so that you only get the teleportation invulnerability only if you used it after at least 30 seconds from the previous teleportation.
On this day,DirtyFleaSackadded two new kits to Survival Royale. This was followed by the Conjuror kit on the next day.
On January 10, 2024, while the gamemode vote is still happening, the naming update happened andStardueadded Name Tags and Books. While the Book being on everyone's wish list for so long, the Name Tag gives your weapons a new, fresh look! The community seemed really welcoming to this update.
On 11 January, DirtyFleaSack added music to Pirates.
On January 13, 2024, Arthur added the world border of open worlds at 200,000 blocks away from spawn. He promised that he would make it 400,000 blocks in the next update.
On 15 January, DirtyFleaSack added another new song to Pirates.
On January 18, 2024, Stardue added an interactive version of the Book Block: the Bookshelf. They can be used to store books. They drop an Empty Bookshelf and all books held. It is "impossible" to get a full bookshelf as an item, except onOneBlock.
For around an hour, the game was in a Beta version, showing Pirates had won the Gamemode Vote. It also added another feature for PC players: Crouch Toggle. It is a new PC feature that has been mobile for some time, and it is pretty good on bridging.Arthur,StardueandDirty Flea Sackdid not mention this on the discord dev-logs.
A rather big update happened. The game interface was changed. This includes the invitation link, which makes the window look better. Pirates won on this update. It was bad, though. The kits are now unbalanced, and the new map isn't fair too.
Scurvy Shore map added
7 new kits
On January 24, 2024, anotherBook-related item, theMailboxwas released. Even though it is a fairly small update, it is still really useful. You could send mail to friends even if they are offline, while not worrying about your messages getting read by others. It also gave the ultimate opportunity to troll.
Sky Wars, even after some time of adding in the game, is still heavily loved and played in the community. This update, although, nerfed Sky Wars coins and kits. It is now more balanced.
Inventory of mobile devices changed drasticallyAccess to the full inventory changed to a backpack from the three dots, and separated from the hotbar.
Access to the full inventory changed to a backpack from the three dots, and separated from the hotbar.
World border expanded to 400,000 blocks (as promised)
On January 30, 2024, Potion-Tipped Arrows[Jan 4]were added by stardue. You could inflict potion effects to arrows, making it a great buff for bow mains. HOWEVER, stardue then mis-coded the Knockback Arrow, which required a Knockback Potion, which was nonexistent at the time.
Fireballs, Iceballs, and Moonstone Explosives returned to One Block. It was initially thought as a bug until Mattzap addressed this in his dev log several days later.
stardue finally realized the issue from when she created the Knockback Arrow: it was non-craftable due to the recipe requiring "knockback potion". Surprisingly, instead of removing or adding the splash version to the recipe, she made "knockback potion" a thing. Drinking it launches you up, pretty much a self-used knockback potion.

↑Official name according tostardue.
An "Enter Bloxd" button was added to PC, forcing players to go full screen before getting into the main menu. It could be fixed on the Game Menu settings by selecting "Disable Full Screen Mode" by going into the Options menu. It was hated by the community.
A few hours after the full screen feature being added,Piratesintroduced a new map, "Treasure Island". It is a clash between 4 teams with some chests with supplies at mid. It is really alike with Bedwars and is harder to win but easier to get coins.
On February 8, 2024, a feature was added that allows players to report each other via the chat. This is very helpful for those who don't have Discord. This feature can also be used to ignore people. However, a flaw is that reasons for reporting a message include things like autoclicking/hacking that cannot be reported through chat. Selecting "Hacking/cheating/autoclicking" will give a link to the Discord server, while selecting "Scamming/griefing/stealing" will tell you that it is not against the rules, and will give tips on how you can avoid this in the future.
On 9 February, players can now have up to five plots in Plots.
On the 12 February,Bloxd.iosuffered amajorsecurity breach, leaking the emails of all Bloxd.io users and their IP addresses through ban info.
Revolux, the creator of the illegal Swift Client, had his Discord account compromised by a hacker called Motion. Through this hacked account, the hacker sent an obfuscated and modified version (added a tokenlogger) of the Swift Client to AgentS (a moderator who later stepped down), asking him to "test" the client for him. AgentS decided to use this client, letting the hacker tamper with AgentS's Discord account and get hold of his Bloxd.io admin ID. This resulted in Motion being able to access to admin.bloxd.io (former bloxd.io admin panel site), allowing them to see all user ID's and IP addresses. Arthur then sent this announcement to the community:
TL;DR: Make a new bloxd account and transfer your account name, all your items, protectors, etc, acrossHey all, unfortunately we had a security breach today. A staff member had their discord account breached. Through that they gained access to the bloxd admin panel. From there, they were able to access all existing player's user ids. No personal data has been obtained. Unfortunately, as they were able to access all player user ids, they are able to log in as any account created before today. This is a result of our anon account id system. Hence - to prevent impersonation & secure your account name, items, protectors, etc.You need to create a new account and transfer your account name, all your items, protectors, etc. This is the only way to ensure the 100% security of your account. For non-transferable things such as worlds, oneblock items, you have a few choices. You can bite the bullet and make a new account, starting from scratch. Or you can hope they didn't make note of your id; they would have had to manually make note of your account's specific id while they had access to the admin panel for them to access your account going forward. So there is a chance your account is safe. The more well known you are in the bloxd community, the higher the risk they did make note.
Because of this incident, Bloxd.io is temporarily down and recovering from all the damage. We hope that Bloxd.io and all of its players, including the victims of the hacker in Discord would recover from this incident and be safe.
On 13 February, the entire game crashed. Players recieved Error 502s and asked for help in Discord and Reddit, trying to find a way to get into Bloxd.io. They claimed they were doomed and kept spamming.
Luckily, the day after the shutdown, the game was fixed. Progress inOneBlockandPirateswas lost. But there is also bad news: some of the players reported that the hacker hacked into their account and did things that break the rules.
The next day,Pirates modeprogress was restored, while some people got theirOneBlockprogress back, some unfortunately, didn't.
Arthur also made another announcement.
Hi all, a few announcements.
First of all, since the above announcement, other community member's discords have been hacked as a result of them using malicious userscripts. This includes KaspenPlayzz's discord account.Do not run any userscripts provided by anyone, even if you trust that person.
We've also made the decision to ban both the use and distribution of userscripts. We just don't see a way to both allow them & ensure the integrity of players' bloxd and discord accounts. It's just too easy to take an existing userscript with significant functionality, modify it slightly to be malicious, and redistribute it.Going forward, either using or distributing userscripts will result in your bloxd account being banned.This also applies to extensions written for bloxd.
I also have an update on the above announcement. They had escalated further than we realised at that time. This is what caused the outage two days ago on 13/02 - as we deleted and recreated all the bloxd servers. There are two impacts from this. The first is there is a chance they accessed the database which stores the email string. They won't have access to your email; the only thing that can happen from this is they send you emails. Bloxd will never send you an email; don't fall victim to a phishing attack. The other impact is they may have accessed our logs containing IPs. The only impact here, if they recorded any, is to know the region for a bloxd id/name. Not much else harm can be done. We're in communication with the ICO.
On 21 February, two new foods are introduced to the game: Rice and Cranberries. They could only be eaten if crafted or scooped up in a bowl, while both of them are really powerful and competitive. Rice restored player's HP and Cranberries gave the Haste effect.
On 26 February,Starduemade a controversial announcement.
Hello!
we are going to add cotton to bloxd, can anyone make a good texture for a cotton plant? if u wanna give it a go, post your suggestions in ⁠「🎭」art-and-mediaand give me a ping! thank u 🌿
Note: the texture has gotta be 8x8 and use a max of 4 different colours to be considered.
This did not receive good reception, as people knew that certain worlds/players would make recreate inappropriate things with cotton and with Sanjay & Sarah skins.
After fairly half a year, a new food update is here: Melon Slices and Watermelon Slices and theirGoldvariants now give Invisibility and Jump Boost respectively. Variants of Bowls of Cranberries now give Haste, which let you break blocks faster, making it a good treat for mining.
Players can now zoom in by pressing [V].
Added Mushrooms and Mushroom Soup
Added Cotton (@vinivieira's textures were implemented forCotton, with wool now needing cotton instead of plants, and Bows and Crossbows also requiring cotton.)
Added Haste Potions and effect
Added FOV (Field of View)
↑Official update name according tostardue.
On 8 March,Factionswere renamed to Tribes. Although it is kept inCreative, it’s still a dust in the eye for some players.
On March 11, 2024,Dirty Flea Sackwrote "oops @Arthur check staging, i goofed hard" on Discord. And so, it was discovered that there was an Anarchy gamemode, currently in staging, which is described as "a Minecraft SMP" and "fake Survival" and so on by players. It is currently unknown whether this gamemode will become a LTM, and possibly go into a gamemode vote with Walls; nor is it known most of the whereabouts of this gamemode. It is just basically Survival but with more harsh and chaotic gameplay. Will it be removed?
Alongside with the rename of Factions to Tribes, protectors are reworked (seeherefor more), while you could also craft protectors that players had been hoping for a long period of time: Tribe Protectors. It is basically a protector, but everyone in that tribe could access it, making teamwork extremely smooth.
Alongside with this, Protectors were found disappearing and glitching. Two devs then apologized with separate announcements.
Hey guys,
I'm really sorry about this, but some code I wrote for the last update has resulted in protectors being removed in certain circumstances. It will have affected the more popular lobbies the most. If you play Survival, Creative or Peaceful and think this might have affected your base, please log in ASAP to secure your stuff. Unfortunately due to the nature of the bug it means we can't reverse the effects, so hopping on to place new protectors is the only way to go.
I know how much of an annoying cat I must be right now, so feel free to 🔥 me in your channel of choice. I was careful to test everything I did thoroughly, but all it takes is one line of code to be slightly off to cause bad issues, and that's what happened this time 😦 I'll be sure to tread even lighter next time 🫡
sorry guys 😦 was mb here too, i reviewed the code & missed the bugunfortunately we don't have backups for the storage we store protector info in, so that's off the table. i'll look into if we're able to add backups to help w. any future issues
As a solution, players got the following items:
15 Diamond Blocks, 15 Moonstone Blocks, and 6 Protectors if spent 30 or more days playing on a Survival/Creative/Peaceful lobby.
5 Diamond Blocks, 5 Moonstone Blocks, and 3 Protectors if spent 7 or more days playing on aSurvival/Creative/Peaceful lobby.
A new Gamemode vote kicked off and it is betweenWallswhich is returning and a new gamemode,Infection. These 2 gamemodes both depend on teamwork while Walls is a grind-and-fight and Infection is more of a tower-defence game. These 2 modes both feature Thumbnails with new graphics.
StardueintroducedBoats, which are the current fastest way of transport apart from flying. It is really welcomed by the community alongside making glitches easier. Rollercoasters are now possible too.
Pirates' progress was found to have been dropped on March 25, 2024. Fortunately, progress was restored just an hour after it happened.
At March 26, 2024, Bloxd.io added languages. The game now supports English and French. Untranslated JavaScript was removed after a few hours, though. Note that only the settings menu and the “Sign in” was changed.
Moonstone Orbsnow deal 40 damage upon landing to the player. This deterred PvP scaredy-cats from running so easily.
There game has more languages. They now translate the loading screens, option menu, and the top left of the main menu. Below is the list of the languages:
Arabic [العربية]
Portuguese (Brazil) [Português (Brazil)]
Dutch [Nederlands]
English
French [Français]
German [Deutsch]
Hindi [हिंदी]
Japanese [日本語]
Chinese (Simplified) [简体中文]
Spanish [Español]
Tamil [தமிழ்]

Italian [Italiano]
Indonesian [Indonesia]
Portuguese [Português]
Vietnamese [Tiếng Việt]
Polish [Polski]
Infection, although was rebalanced multiple times, was still feasible for zombies to win. This update, however, added kits for zombies. Every kit does has its major weaknesses, though.
Some say it is, while some say it is not. The pre-release told us that Infection had won the vote, while flags of the respective countries are available in the language section. Turns out, it is all true.
This update was seemingly not-so-major, but it is revolutionary in building. They added Dark Red Stone, Dark Red Bricks, Obsidian and Golden Decoration in Survival, Peaceful and Creative, and also their crafting recipes. The crafting recipe for Magma has also been changed.
There is also new music in Survival, Peaceful, Creative and Plots gamemodes.
The update also added particles when you break a block and blocks move more when you break it. Dropped items has been increased by gravity. Protectors will now only disappear if their owner or one of their allowed editors has not logged in for over 30 days.
Projectiles (pebbles, snowballs, splash potions, arrows) and also boats are now infinite in creative.
On April 11th2024, the Tall Grass which was one block tall changed into the one that was two block tall and the old Tall Grass changed to normal Grass.
The day after the tall grass, a small update was added which was the G button. It shows all players in game and in point based-modes shows them as well. This replaced /players, although quick typists still do that.
As another day rolled around, the arms for Zombies in Infection were lifted by 180 degrees.
The Water Bucket’s physics were changed. You could now place water on water, allowing instant elevators, quick bridges and more feasible water building, if you have infinite.
Created byOliver, this update introduces bobbing. It also adds smooth crouching and getting out of Boats. You can find the bobbing toggle in the control section of the options menu.
The biggestInfectionupdate, at least for now, is launched byOliver. It now features kits for humans, bonus diamonds, coins, and more.

The thumbnail forSurvivalandCubeWarfarewas changed, you can still find their thumbnail in the galleryhere.
A bug inInfectionoccurred as you can now break blocks although they regenerate, similar to breaking blocks in aProtectedchunk. This allows players to skip almost every door. The bug was fixed after around a day.
Anarchyshowed up in the main Bloxd.io page against a new game mode,Factions. The two game modes did not recive good reception, though, at they were removed again after a few hours of showing up.
Five game modes including original ones are renamed. Here are them:
OneBlock -> One Block
CubeWarfare -> Cube Warfare
EvilTower -> Evil Tower

To kick off the new year,DirtyFleaSackbrought back an Illegal Item deleted in 2022: theMoonstone Axe. Many were expecting for it to have the same function as it's older self[Jan 1], but it was updated: It chops another 7 Blocks made of Wood above the Wooden Block that the player chopped in addition to the Block itself. This saves a huge amount of time from chopping Trees, and also allows the griefing of bases made of Wood much faster. The Moonstone Axe also drops whole Melons and Watermelons if you mine them with it.
On the same day,“The Bridge”has also be renamed to “Bridge”.
Also, one of thedevs(presumed DirtyFleaSack as well) added the previously game mode-exclusive Items to Worlds. This included the Remote Moonstone Explosives, Bouncy Bombs, and more.
On 8 January, without warning, an newGamemodeappeared instaging.bloxd.io: Defusal, aGamemodesimilar to Counter-Strike, where one team tries to plant a bomb, while the other attempts to stop the planters.
Also on this day, an update was made so you can now eat Raw Meats that can give youPoisoned Effectfor 5 seconds.
On 13 January, thedevsfinally added WorldBuilder, which, similar to the WorldEdit mod in Minecraft, allowed players to manipulate the World and Blocks with a few Commands, like deleting whole Chunks, spawning a bunch of Blocks of Diamond, or even copy structures and paste it in another World! However, some used this as an exploit to delete the entire map of aBedwarsgame, or copied entire maps and some people used worldbuilder to build their house in greenville, making them have cherries and corn. But the bugs were fixed. Then, a few players who knew coding, like RealSlothuLT3 and Blueandpandaiscool have made websites which you can download schematics from.
The day after the addition of WorldBuilder, a new gamemode appeared:One Block Wide, an open-world, except that it is only one Block wide.
Also a new way to obtain Coal was added: by smelting 4 Wood Logs in a Furnace, allowing it to be the first Ore that can be infinitely expended and not run out.
On 16 January, A new chat UI is added to game. The Lava Bucket was also added, but was then removed shortly after.
On 22 January, a new variant of Bedwars was added: Trios, a replicate of Squads with one less player on each team.
On 29 January, a new feature called "Fog" was added to the game, it will not be used by default, but you can use it in the "Graphics" settings.
There is also an update for mobs: increased number of Items dropped by Mobs.
On 31 January, Lava and Lava Bucket are back after half a month of removal, Lava will deal 10 HP if you touch it and have no Armor. In addition, there is a new type of Boat called Obsidian Boat that can go on Lava which normal Boats cannot. You need 6Obsidianto make an Obsidian Boat.
Also, Obsidian can no longer be crafted with a Furnace and must be mixed with Water and Lava. Finally, the crafting method of Magma has changed, instead of using Stone and Coal to craft it, it has been changed to a Bucket of Lava.
↑The old Moonstone Axe was the only Axe able to chop all kinds of Wood, whereas the other Axes could only chop Maple wood.
On February 6, Worlds were gone, replaced by a new UI for Gamemodes when you click on them. The devs also gave special Lobby Cards which act like thumbnails.
There are also two new buttons in the Lobby Owner, Lobby Color and Lobby Emojis. Find out more about it on thethis page.
On February 7, you were able to gift your friend a Super Rank package, and you were the one paying for thatSuperRankpackage.
Additionally you can purchase the Super Rank package if you play at CrazyGames.
On February 10, There are two "Mobs (not really Mobs)" added to the game, the Fat Red Mushroom and the Fat Brown Mushroom. As you jump on them multiple times, your jump height will gradually increase. You can find these 2 “Mobs” in ForestBiomeslike Maple Forest, but they are rare. They can also be crafted by using 4 normal Red/Brown Mushrooms.
On February 13, a new Food has been added, "Chili Peppers", which spawn in allDeserts. When you eat it, you will gain Heat Resistance, which prevents all damage when you jump into Lava. You can also make aPotioncalled "Heat Resistance Potion" with 1 Water Bottle and 1ChiliPeppers.
On February 18, a update was added that allows you to create and edit in-game code with Boards in a similar fashion to Press to __ boards.
On February 20, two new updates were added,
Fall Damage: In the World Lobbies settings, it became possible to toggle Fall Damage, e.g. each Block above 5 Blocks = 4 Damage.
Smart Animals:Mobsnow learned how to walk, move faster and run away from the player when attacked!
The update came with another unspoken feature that makes thePlayer'shead rotate on its own, independent of the rest of the body.
On February 22, An update where an advertisement for Super Rank was added.
On February 24, Two updates were added yet again.
1. Bedwars Lucky Rebalance: Fall Damage got (controversially) added to Bedwars as an additional tweak to the game. A lot of rebalancing was made to the Shop and new Lucky Items were added again. Roles were also added.
2. Code Block: Code Blocks essentially act like Boards with way more space and with a navy blue background. You still have to use a Board to execute the Code Block though. This allows people to code with way less limitations compared to the previous Board method.
On March 3, a new perspective mode where you can see yourself from the front. Before 2025, people were unable to use front camera, the only perspectives before were the View from Eyes(first person) and View from Behind(third person).It's also hard to move since the movement keys are switched when you are in front camera:
W: going back
S: going forward
A: going right
D: going left
Also, there's a glitch when you go to Eyes Perspective(aka first person mode), your body, arms, items in hand, and armour appear. This glitch seems to be the most common on Bedwars.
On March 7, A new mob calledCave Golemwhich spawns in caves is added, becoming the 4th mob in the game. It is also the first mob that can attack the player (not counting Zombies). When the mob dies, it will drop 1 Moonstone Fragment and 0-10 Mossy Messy Stone.
On March 12, an unspecified update happened without the devs talking about it. The gamemodes menu now takes the whole screen and has a “Back to Games”  button to send you back to the main menu. Also, loading schematics now allows you to save a schematic into a menu that allows you to load schematics across multiple worlds for better time saving.
World owners can now use WorldBuilder and Schematics in their worlds by Typing //help here’s some commands:
//pos1 - sets position 1
//pos2 - sets position 2
//copy - copy’s block in the selected region aka the area of pos1 to pos2
//paste - pastes the copied blocks, does not copy loot chests in ruins and protectors
//set “BlockName” - sets all the blocks in the selected region the block you want
//replace “BlockName1” “BlockName2” - replaces BlockName1 with BlockName2 in the selected region
//schematic save - Saves a schematic to profile.
//schematic load - Loads a schematic to world.
Also, there is a update change UI of Create Worlds.
Natural Disaster Survival was a limited time gamemode released in March 18th by an unknown developer of the game and was discovered early by the community by joining him with thefriendstab. It was leaked 2 days before it's release and removed a day after.
On March 20, There is a new update, which is adding 2 terrain types Flat and One Block Wide. Making 4 terrain types along with default and schematic.
On March 21, you could create a custom Bedwars lobby, using Custom Lobby Blocks to create parts of the map.
On March 22, you could create a custom Skywars lobby, using Custom Lobby Block to create parts of the map.
On March 25, you can now make custom maps forCube Warfare,Bridge,Rocket SpleefandRocket Obby.
On March 27, a hidden gamemode was leaked by people joining the devs playingMinigames. It was added to staging later on the same day.
OnApril 1, Bloxd was made temporarily left-handed for 24 hours onApril Fools. It is a real prank to everyone since the real left handed day is onAugust 13.
On the same day, theMinigamesgamemode was removed from staging.
On April 3,Game Competition Winnerswas added to Bloxd. Consisting of 4 winners worlds from Discord.
On April 4,Draugr Zombieswere added to Bloxd.io. The fifth mob in-game! Also see more information inDraugr Zombiepage.
On April 7, Red Arrows Around Invisible Circle Now Appears WhenYoutake Damage.
On April 10, Factions was permanently removed from Bloxd. All the memories are now gone, it’s the past. Also you can't join it by all ways (links or other).
On April 11, Draugr Skeleton added to Bloxd. It is inspired by Minecraft's Skeleton. It will shoot you because it is a hostile mob. When it dies, it will drop Bones or Arrows.
On April 17, Mob Spawners were added to Bloxd. Just like Minecraft's Mob Spawners, it spawns mobs in a specific radius. If the mob spawners have a red edge, it indicates it is a hostile mob spawner. Similarly, a green edge indicates a passive mob spawner.
To start this month, Bloxd added custom games (made by players) you can now make your own game! This lead to the removal of Game Competition Winners unfortunately.
Hostile mobs have made their way to the surface... and they've brought a new biome with them the Frozen Badlands! Explore this new biome to find a new tree type, new blocks, and new mobs. Pay special attention for the Draugr Knight, which will now spawn deep in caves too. Knights are the apex predator of Bloxd- they're fast, agile and carry a Diamond Sword. They're absolutely vicious, and can jump 4 blocks vertically, but if manage to conquer them in combat, you'll get a Diamond Fragment for your troubles. Good luck! (You'll need it...)
On May 7, theDraugr Knight's reach was nerfed and it's speed was slightly nerfed to stop it from being too overpowered.
On may 9th of 2025, Tom (one of the game's devs), added the following to the game's coding system:
Client Options:  A player's "Client Options" impact what they are capable of doing in the world. For example you can give them a double jump by setting the player'sairJumpCountto1. Alternatively their health bar can be increased by setting theirmaxHealthto200.
Entity Settings: An "Entity Setting" impacts how a player sees or interacts with another player or entity. E.g. Player 1 could have anotherEntitySettingfor entity 2 as opacity set to0.5. This means player 1 sees entity 2 as partly see-through. Player1 is the relevant player, player2 is the targeted player.
Mob Settings:These impact the behaviour of mobs, what they look like, and how they sound. These can either be set on a per-mob basis or the default can be set for all mobs of a particular type.
These changes lead to a massive upgrade to Bloxd's coding community and it's initial limitations.
On May 15, Bloxd.io developers added Aura XP, with the addition of a new activity: Enchant. You can collect Aura XP by the following ways: smelting ores (applies to Iron and Gold), killing animals, killing players (players with Aura XP will lose about half or less, and players without Aura XP, the killer will gain 1 level of Aura XP). Aura XP has a level cap of 300. To enchant, you need an Enchantment Table. Enchantment tables come in 5 types: Wood, Stone, Iron, Gold, and Diamond. The harder it is to collect an Enchantment Table (Diamond is the hardest to collect), the more expensive it is, but the rarer it is.
On May 16, The developers have added 4 types of animals: Deer, Wolf, Bear and Stag. The Stag also has a variant that drops large amounts of Gold Nuggets and Golden Watermelons when killed. Wolves can also be tamed by right-clicking on it with a bone and once tamed, they will fight for you if you attack another player/mob. They spawn in the newly improved pine forest biome, which also added new grass and wood types. A new hostile mob will presumably also be added alongside variants of ruins.
On May 23, enchanting had expanded and there are more things to enchant and how to get aura xp. You can use potions, arrows and “portable orbs” of xp to gain aura xp and you can enchant pickaxes, axes, shovels, bows, crossbows, and sticks.
On May 27, there was a new gamemode calledGoldrush. Goldrush is a game where you have to mine the gold, bring the gold back to spawn and gain points for your team. You can also mine iron for upgrades.
On May 30 (the last update), the salvaging table and more mob loot were added. The salvaging table salvaged items and ores. The salvaging table would uncraft items to get the ores you used to make with. You can craft a salvaging table with 4 Wood Planks and 2 Iron Bars. The new mob loot is Knight Hearts, Golem Eyes, and use for fur. Knight Hearts can be used to craft Knight Swords. Golem Eyes can be used to craft Golem Pickaxes. Fur can now be crafted into a chestplate fur and spike boots.
For the start of summer and a new month, Bloxd added Chalk that appears in rivers. It can be used to make colored chalk blocks for builders using the artisan bench. The New App Update fixed some bugs in the app that were there.
On June 12, a new game mode called Simon Says based on the real life game of the same name. There will be 10 tasks to perform and you need to do it quickly to win the game with points. The score is based on the time taken, the faster the more points.
Additionally, a major thumbnail update has been added and applied to 13 game modes and 2 player modes:Survival,Peaceful,Creative,Bedwars,One Block,Cube Warfare,Infection,Sky Wars,Evil Tower,Bloxd Hop,Doodle Cube,Parkour Obby Games,Hide and Seek,Murder Mystery, andCustom Games.
Simon Says was removed as a game abruptly just two days after it was added.
New 2 Bedwars Maps made byHarrythe new dev were released. They are called Rooftops and Tavern.
On June 20th, sleeping was added. This update also added leaf beds and added strong beds (before illegal) to survival. Sleeping gives perks that vary depending on the strength of the bed slept on (leaf, regular, strong bed).
For this new month,Bloxdhas fully changed all gamemode thumbnails, so they are not old.
On July 3, The Jungle update added Jungle Wood (renamed from Elm Wood) and 2 new mobs,WildcatandGorilla. There is also a new food calledBanana, which when eaten will have a Double Jump Effect.Mangois a real food, but it is used to throw in the game for Knockback.
A new Rocket Obby map called “January” is added as a sub-gamemode for Rocket Obby. It is supposed to be the harder version of the original one. Speaking of the map name, it is made by January.
On that same day, Oliver decided to make Bloxd.io on the list of actually being the App Store. While looking at the reviews, most people were rating it bad because a glitch it prevents them from playing.
This feature allows people to see how many players in total are in that specific gamemode.

Bloxd HopInfoDescriptionJump your way through varied parkour mapsDeveloperWeiqing(Creation)Arthur(Shop and development)Script Nameparkour
Bloxd Hopis a simple parkour gamemode. The goal is to reach the end by standing on the Emerald Block after completing the previous stages marked with Gold Blocks. Players can gain Gold and XP by standing and checkpoints and completing quests, which can then be used to give the player an advantage during play. this was the very first gamemode added toBloxd.io.
Players will jump from block to block in order to reach checkpoints marked with Gold Blocks, and will win when standing on the Emerald Block located at the end of the map.
Bloxd Hop can be played in two modes: Buffs and No Buffs. Type/nobuffsin the chat to switch between the two modes. When switched, the player will be teleported back to the start of the map, with their timer reset too.
In this mode you can buy yourself Powerups and use Blockers to help yourself complete the map with ease and/or very quickly.
In this mode you can't use Powerups and Blockers, making it much harder to complete the maps quickly.
Gold is one of the main currencies in Bloxd Hop, used to buy powerups for the player. Gold can be earned by reaching checkpoints, completing maps, or by completing tasks.
Experience, or XP, is the second currency in Bloxd Hop, used to buy permanent upgrades for the player. Experience can be gained by reaching checkpoints, and completing maps.
Level Tokens are the currency used to purchase the Level upgrades, they are obtained after a certain number of Experience is gained.
Press [M] on your keyboard (or set a custom keybind under the name "Open Tasks and Leaderboard") to view your current Tasks and the Leaderboard for fastest completion times.
Tasks are mini-objectives in Bloxd Hop which grant you 10-50 gold upon completion. There are always 3-5 Tasks available, and you must complete one task to get a new one. <-- Another way to switch Tasks is by simply joining a different lobby.--> Tasks include:
Find [Colour][taskNotes 1]Wool and stand on it
Activate [Number] checkpoints
Reach [Number] of checkpoints into the map
Jump [Number] times
Complete a map
Play for 5 minutes
Say anything in chat
Join Bloxd.io Discord directly from the game[taskNotes 2]
Reset your position by pressing R![taskNotes 3]
↑Colour can be Light Blue, Blue, Purple, Red, Orange, Yellow, or Lime
↑This task can be obtrusive because it randomly appears even if you have already joined Discord Server
↑This task is completed when "Special Action 1" is pressed, meaning if you change its keybind to another key that isn't [R], the task will still complete normally.
The Leaderboard shows the best runs by logged-in players made on all maps and in both modes (buffs and no buffs). You can choose to see the best runs for today, this week, or all time. < --Many players cheated and used glitches, hacks, or clients to get good places on the Leaderboard. Most of those runs have been deleted from the Leaderboard by the developers. -- >
The Leaderboard also shows the players with the most Gold earned today, this week, and all time.
Players can choose to either view the leaderboard with the closest 25 players to them in both directions, or to see the top 50 players.
The Shop can be accessed by pressing [B] on your keyboard (or set a custom keybind under the name "Open Shop").
Bloxd Hop has several commands available, used mostly to give information on a specific subject to the player using the command.
Displays the full list of chat-based commands with this message:Commands Available: /rtv, /players, /played, /xp, /nobuffs
Voting in-progress message:[Username of the player using the command]wants to rtv![Current vote count]/[Half the number of players in the lobby]to rtv.
Successful voting message:[Username of the player using the command]wants to rtv! Rtv successful, switching maps.
Current players in lobby:[Username of player in the lobby],[Username of another player in the lobby]
Disabling message:Buffs are now not allowed!You will no longer be able to buy or gain buffs!Type /nobuffs again to change it!
Enabling message:Buffs are now allowed.You will now be able to buy and gain buffs!Type /nobuffs again to change it!
Bots are entities that can join Bloxd Hop lobbies and act somewhat as a real player. They were most likely made to make players feel less alone in smaller lobbies. When in-game, they will jump around, completing parkour from time to time, but mostly failing.
There are a few messages you can receive in Chat that are limited to Bloxd Hop.
[Player name]has joined!(Works for real players and bots)
Use /rtv to vote skip this map.(Displayed when you join a lobby)
Use Enter to send a message.(Displyed when you join a lobby)
[Player name] has jumped for the first time!(Works only for real players who have never played before or have cleared their browsing history. )
Map will change in 5 minutes!/Map will change in 60 seconds!
[Player name]has completed the map in[Number]seconds with powerups!/[Player name]has completed the map in[Number]seconds without powerups!
There are also some messages that pop up in the top-right corner of your screen while playing. They mostly display achievements you reached like activating many Checkpoints, jumping a lot of times, finishing Maps, being the first one to finish the Map this round etc. These stats can't be viewed anywhere and are wiped if you clear your cookies even for logged-in users.
A similar pop-up message appears also when the map is switched to a different one: Map has changed to [map name]
Some of these messages are also hints on how to being more successful in the Parkour or words of encouragement:
Sometimes jumping diagonally is worse than jumping straight!
Think about the jumps before you do them!
Practice makes perfect!
And many more.
Almost all of the parkour is made out ofColoured Wool, but there are other blocks used to create the backround in some of the maps. The parkour maps, except forCrossingColoursandStarrySkies, can be downloaded for use onMinecraftas aMinecraftschematic file,
and they are linked on theBloxd.io Credits Page.
This is a map where you can choose two paths, which are signified by different colours, but they cross. You can choose red, which is shorter but harder, or green which is longer but easier. However, you can switch between the two at any time. This is the shortest map.
This is a map where you Parkour around a village made of Pine Wood and other Blocks. The Wool colour is Cyan - It goes through the village and increases its difficulty by making difficult jumps - there is also Glass in this map.
This is a colourful map which has most of the Wool colours. This is the longest map in Bloxd Hop. Buying double jump is recommended, as you can skip lots of jumps. The biggest skip in the map is with double jump and some Blockers or just triple jump. Towards the end the checkpoints become fewer and fewer.
This map goes through a castle. The Wool colours are Orange and Pink. Like in CrossingColours the course splits in some places into a Red (harder) and Orange (easier) course. You can use the Planks at the start of the castle entrance to your advantage to skip a small section of Parkour. If you buy enough Blockers, you can pass about 90% of the course - this is not recommended.
This is a map where you Parkour around Iron Man's (Tony Stark's) resort. The Wool colour is Magenta, Blue, and Purple.
Iron Man's Mansion was created byjar9and uploaded to Minecraft Schematicshere. The schematic does not include the wool parkour seen in-game.
Bloxd Hop also has its own website calledbloxdhop.io.
Bloxd Hop used to be called BloxdHop like OneBlock, EvilTower, etc.

1.2Concept and Mechanics
1.3Applications (not exhaustive)
1.4More Musings?
Board machines are mechanisms comprised of linked press to __ boards that use boards to perform actions usually related to a player's inventory.
Boards are writables in the gamebloxdthat allow the player to write on a UI and they render with a Maple plank texture. For more, seeWritables#'Press to ' Boards.
When one press to __board is triggered. it will attempt to fufill the trade by interacting with the player's inventory and either a chest or the game itself. If: the trade is fufilled, AND there is another valid board adjacent to it(touching), it will trigger that board and attempt to fufill its trade. These same rules also apply to the boards triggered by other boards, which allows for chain reactions and hence chain actions, creating crude redstone. However, there is a rule in place that nerfs the potential of this system, which is that no more than 50 board actions may take place at once. This severely limits the complexity and functionality of board circuits.
While there are many applications yet to be considered, some prominent ones that immediately comes to mind:
-Storage system, where common items can be stored and retrieved in fixed qty.
-Armoury, where PvP gear and armour can be automatically dispensed and stripped off for quick and convenient swapping of sets.
-Scam machines, where a single curious click could cause a cascade of signs attempting to drain the inventory of valuables (not recommended/endorsed!)
To ensure that every board in a circuit is triggered, null trades can be used-nothing costs nothing-to carry the signal, and all boards adjacent to these signal carriers will be triggered, regardless of the failure of any other boards. This comes with its own downsides, being that signal-carrying boards cannot perform other functions, and still count towards the 50-operation limit. The more independent the boards are of each other, the less boards there can be to actuate a certain task. The challenge, as well as the fun, lies in finding a balance and the most efficient way to allocate the position of the signs.

4Trivia
Boats can be crafted with any type of Plank. Boats can be retrieved by hitting them once. Hold on the exited Boat on mobile.
Boats can be used for the transportation of players.
You can transport on water, land and Ice. Moving on Water is fast, Ice is even faster to ride on when your on a boat at the same time, but rowing on land makes you go extremely slowly. You can also ascend Ladders and Vines in a Boat, which is very fast.
A player can enter or exit a Boat by right-clicking on it. Tap in the Boat once on mobile. You can also exit a Boat by crouching or holding a Hang Glider.
A player can control the Boat using WASD or the arrow keys. However, they need to steer the Boat by pointing their mouse in the desired direction. It is basically same as moving on both devices.
The Obsidian Boat works the same as a normal Boat but can be used to float on Lava without taking damage unlike the wooden boat. Craft it from 6 Obsidian.
Obsidian BoatInformationMaximum Stack1Best Tool to MineFist

If you didn't exit the Boat before teleportation, the Boat will teleport with you as well.
You cannot place Boats anywhere else other than on Water and LavaBlocks. However, you can get it on land using teleportation, but it will travel at a low speed.
Ice does speed up the Boat gradually, going so fast that it confuses the anticheat, holding you back frequently.
Hitting someone who sits in a Boat on water used to give them more knockback than usual, going so fast that it confused the anticheat, holding that player back frequently.
You used to be able to phase through walls with Boats. SeeGlitchesfor more.
Now, if you die by void death, the Boat will "separate" from you, fall down for a short distance, and then bounce up as if there was some sort of bouncy material in the void. Then it disappears.
Holding aHang Glideror Crouching whilst in a Boat will eject you from the Boat.
If you are in a Boat, you will get a effect called "Boating" with no duration.
The Boat makes the noise of the player walking as there is no custom boat sound effect for the boat.

AWritableis an Item that you can write on. There are currentlythreefour in the game:Boards,Books,Name Tag, and Code Blocks.WritablesA Name Tag, Book and Board

The Board, with the special arrow symbol on it (type -> on board)
TheBoardis a special transparentBlockthat can be used to store text. Boards can convert the symbols->and<-into these symbols:→and←as seen on the right, but they're patched due to new font settings. The text has three sizes: small, medium and large. This helps to convey messages differently, as if you want to warn about something or title something, you can use the large size, or if you are writing a long username or a short paragraph about something, you would use the small size. If your word is too long the text will go to the next row, even if the word is not complete.
Boards appear as a thin, rectangular prism with the MapleWoodPlanks texture on it.
You write on a Board by pressing[E]or right-clicking while aiming at it. A new UI appears that allows you to type choose from the three text sizes. Click on the side of the Board to publish what you wrote. It is possible to put emojis on Boards.
If you are the owner of an OpenWorld, you can create special Boards that activate when you[Right-Click]or press[E]. There are nine types of boards: 'press to get' Boards, 'press to lobby' Boards, 'press to tp' Boards, 'press to buy' Boards, 'press to mode' Boards, 'press to damage' Boards, 'press to execute' Boards, 'press to message' Boards and 'press to sell' Boards. If you have multiple Special Boards next to each other, they will all activate, unless one fails to activate ( for "press to buy/sell", not having enough items to buy/sell ) then the chain will activate up to that sign but not past. You can edit 'Press to __' Boards by Right Clicking/Pressing "E".
A press to get Board behaves similarly to command Blocks fromMinecraftwith the /give command. It gives a certain amount of a certain type of Items to the player who presses it. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
If you do not have enough room on one line, such as '999Moonstone Orb', you can put the 'Moonstone Orb' bit on a new line, and it would still work. When typing a specific Item name, be sure to use the correct name, or the Board won't execute the command (e.g. Type 'Block ofDiamond' instead of "diamond block"). Never use the plural form of the item name.
The item name mustn't be a specified number, you can also write for example 1-10 Dirt to give out a random count of items.
A press to lobby Board teleports you to the specified lobby.  To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
This only works in the Worlds gamemode because there is no owner of the public lobbies.  (Note that the "press to" parts are not caps-sensitive)
A press to tp Board teleports you to the specified coordinates. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
A press to buy Board allows
to buy a certain thing for a certain price. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
A press to sell Board allows users to sell a certain thing for a certain price. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
Added on December 10, 2024 (however it was possible to do before, it just wasn't listed anywhere as a function), this board is used to sell all the items in your inventory to buy nothing, replacing the old feature where you had place many chests just to perform the same effect
Added on December 10, 2024, this board is used to randomize the number of items you can collect when you press the board.
Takes health from a player that presses it.
Added on December 10, 2024, this table is used to change your mode.

These Boards can be created in all other game modes with Boards by anyone.

Similar to a press to buy Board, but it must be placed on a Chest and the Chest must contain the Items that will be bought.
Similar to a press to sell Board, but it must be placed on a Chest and the Chest must contain the Items that will be paid.
Press to execute boards can execute other boards that are at the position we provide. Like most boards functions, execute boards can only be made by an owner of a lobby.
Added on December 10, 2024, this board is used for chatting, when clicked it will show messages from Lobby Msg (msg is Message).

If special boards are beside each other the effect chains together.
Boards were the first writable Item in the game.
People used to write press to buy Boards in the lobby after the leak of it resulting to people getting rich.
On August 4, 2024, there was abuginGreenvillewhere items could be obtained using the press to get Board. It was possible to obtainillegal items, which were:Allium, Forget-me-not, Pear Sapling,Bedrock, etc.
In aGreenvilleglitch, you can use Press to get Board to getitemsthat are banned in Greenville (e.g.Fireball, Iceball,Moonstone Explosive), which are very useful as they can be used to breakblocksthat are almost impossible to find (e.g. Emerald Block, Lapis Block, Invisible Solid).
You used not be able to edit a 'Press to __' board after making it, so you would have to destroy it to edit it once again.
If you put a negative value (e.g. -1, -5) into a press to damage board, you will gain health upon pressing it
If you're muted you don't have the ability to chat, but also to use boards and books.
A Book
ABookis an Item used to write text. You can write anything, from stories to guides, or even notes.
A Book looks like it has a leather cover with white, paper pages.
By right-clicking or pressing[E]anywhere while holding a Book in their hand, the player can open a text editor.
Using this UI, the player can write a single Book up to 10 pages long, with up to 247 characters per page. The player can write up to 2,470‌ characters inside the entire Book. No page may be longer than 13 lines and each line can have a width of 19 characters.
A Book can be published by clicking the "Publish" button at the bottom of a Book. Clicking on "Title" at the top of a book will enter the editor for the title of the Book. The Book can later be edited by anyone, by clicking on the "Edit" button. If you are the publisher (the last person to edit the Book), the Book will say that you made the Book, stating "Book by [Player Name]". You can copy/paste from and into the Book. a
Books can be stored inBookshelvesandMailboxes.
This was added along with the Name Tag.
When the Book was added, there was a secret message hidden in the Book left byStardueon the last page of every Book. It read, "Arthur stinks. - Stardue". These messages were removed soon from all Books.
The swear filter exists in Books.
If you create a Book inSkywarsand write on it, it will not save.
If you place a Book in a chest then mine the chest, the book will be empty.
If you have a book containing words and you are killed, all the words in the book will disappear.
Dupe Bookshelf Empty: First, you must have 1 book and 1 Empty Bookshelf, then continuously press the E button or right click, the Empty Bookshelf will fall out continuously.
If you're muted you don't have the ability to chat, but also to use books and boards.
A Name Tag
TheName Tagis an Item that can be used to rename other Items. Name Tags can only rename non-stackable Items, likeFoodandEquipment. The Name Tag is NOT aPlayer Name Tagand cannot renameentities. The descriptions of renamed Items will still stay after renaming them.
The Name Tag can not rename a Name Tag or Book, even though they're not stackable.
If the item that you renamed has been changed, the new name will disappear.
Changing an item includes:
Using aWater Bucketor filling an emptyBucket
Turning a Coconut into aCracked Coconut
Drinking aPotionthat was renamed
Eating Bowl ofRiceorCranberries
The Name Tag appears as a beige tag with a white hook on top.
The UI after right clicking while holding a Name Tag
Right click while holding the Name Tag in your hand. This will send you to an UI that looks somewhat like a Board.
Write the name you want the Name Tag to rename an Item Into.
Click "finish". The renamed Tag will be in your hand, called "Rename to: [Item name]."
In your Inventory, grab it with your mouse and click with it on the Item you want to rename.
Once dropped on the Item, the name tag will disappear, and the Item is renamed.
You cannot rename currently equipped armor.
The Name Tag was added along with the Book.
The Name Tag was created byStardue.
Unlike before, now if you give a renamed Item to a different player, the rename will still be there.
If you die with a renamedItemin yourInventory, the rename will be still there.
The censoring system still exists, so you cannot name anything inappropriate.
Unlike inMinecraft, you can name an Item "Name Tag".
You are able to press enter to make a new row in name tags, making the Item name can go upwards.
The longest discoveredItemname is something like this: ‘**************************$&!’, with a total of 29 characters. You can do this by naming it: "fu fu fu fu fu …" until you run out of space. This will trick the swear system into thinking it is the f word, so it is phrased into *****. “Fu” is 2 characters long, while ***** is 5 characters long. Meaning it will get a 3 extra character bonus, breaking the system.
If you place a Name Tag inside a chest and break the chest, the Name Tag will be empty.
If you place a renamed item into a chest and break the chest, the item name will change back to its default name.

BotsorRobot Playersare the first ever AI-controlled entity in the game.
These entities can only be found inEvilTower,Doodle Cube, andBloxdHop. The entities cannot look up or down which makes them pretty easy to spot. It has been theorized that the bots are like recordings of previous players, they simply copy their actions in the next round of a game. Since the bots are basically recordings of a player's movements, they can phase through block if the map is modified.

Your starting Inventory contains: 1Iron Swordto fight your opponents, 64Concretein the colour of your team (Red or Blue),  1 Iron Pickaxe to mine the opponent's Concrete defense and 1 Bread to heal yourself. At the center of the bridge is a WhiteBaked СlayBlock - this is where the colour changes.
Your base is a small building with a hole in the middle. There are two ways to access the hole: by entering the hole from the inside and jumping in from the roof. When in a game it is important toBlockthese areas. You cannot build in the base.
Instead of 3, players needed to score 5 points to win.
InDuels, players start the match with the following items:
Iron Sword
64 Red/Blue Concrete
Iron Pickaxe
Bread
999 Messy Stone

It was possible to obtain the Lava Bucket by right-clicking with a Bucket on a Fat Cactus, but this feature was removed one day later. What's more special is that Lava returned on January 31, 2025, just half a month after its removal. Its texture has changed to not resemble Water, it's not transparent anymore and is currently the only Block that has an animated texture. You can see the "new" Lava in Lava lakes, appearing in someBiomeslike Plains and Desert. They can also spawn underground and in ravines.Boatscan't move on Lava (when you sit on a Boat in Lava, you will take damage), so there is a new Item called Obsidian Boat, with which you can float on both Water and Lava without getting damaged. On February 13, 2025, An additional food item, called Chilli Peppers, which when eaten grants Heat Resistance, and you take no damage while in lava.

Empty Buckets used to be non-stackable.
Water Buckets aren’t the only way to place Water (the other is a Block called "Water", which isillegal)
Water and Lava Buckets are unstackable, meaning you can rename a Water Bucket, but the name will change back to Bucket if you empty the Water Bucket.

Buggy Blocks- these areblocksthat have strange names and have been replaced with new ones.
Reserved RotationBlockswere obtained by players as a result of code hackingBloxd.io. InOne BlockandGreenville, players received free_placeholder2 due to being replaced with a new Bookshelfblock. Originally, these bookshelves were glitched as called "Bookshelf" instead of "Empty Bookshelf". Unfortunately, Arthur has patched this, stopping these illegal bookshelves from becoming itself in Greenville as a result to prevent glitched blocks. As a result, whenever you mine a full bookshelf in a house that you started in, it'll instead drop empty bookshelf. Even if you try to take books out, it won't work.

--- Page 59: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Bunny_Hop_Counter ---
Bunny Hop CounterInformationDescriptionAllows You To Leap Over Bigger Gaps!

TheBunny Hop Counteris a feature inBloxd.iothat allows players to look at their current level of bunny hops. This feature was introduced and developed by Arthur on October 11, 2024. The looks of it is simple, a small bunny head with the text "Bunny Hop" written beside it.
Bunny hopping is a technique that grants players an extra speed boost, enabling them to traverse the game environment more swiftly and perform advanced maneuvers. The Bunny Hop Counter tracks the number of consecutive successful bunny hops a player performs, providing real-time feedback and encouraging mastery of this skill.
Before aking what is bunnyhopping inBloxd.ioyou must understand how to execute it:
Timing Your Jump: Press the jump key at the exact moment your character lands when walking or sprinting.
Achieving Consecutive Hops: If you achieve doing this, the jumps will give you a speed boost of 1.1x speed and will show a bunnyhop icon in the bottom-left corner.
With all of this in mind, if you succeed at consecutively doing Bunny Hops,
Extended Jumps: Bunny Hops will make you able to jump way further and up to 7 blocks!
Neo Jumps: Doing a Bunny Hop can help you clear neos easier and do Bunny Hop-exclusive jumps like the 5 neo jump and the 6 1/2 neo jump. The 6 1/2 neo jump is a 6 neo with an extra gap at the end and then a block, like this:
The gap can be at the start; however, it will make it easier to perform.
Doing a Bunny Hop successfully will result a trail of bluish particles spawning in the player's feet. (generic_5)
The Bunny Hop Counter was a highly requested demand in theBloxdcommunity before its actual release.
The Bunny Hop Counter was actually removed from the game whenArthurdecided to add particles to successful Bunny Hops. Fortunately, it was added back shortly after.
The Bunny Hop Effect Isn't an actual effect according to the game's coding.

The Cave Golem is the 4th Mob added to the game. It was added on: March 7, 2025. It is the first Mob that is able attack Players. It could have been inspired by the Iron Golem inMinecraft, a Mob that protects Villagers in that game. The Cave Golem is about 3 meters (3 Blocks) tall.
When you killed a Cave Golem, it used to drop: 5-10 Mossy Messy Stone and 1 Golem Eye. You can use a golem eye to craft a Golem Pickaxe.
Cave Golems spawn inCaves. They can also be spawned with Cave Golem Spawn Orbs and Spawners.
The Golem’s Eye can be used to craft a Golem Pickaxe, similar to the Moonstone Pickaxe. It’s ability is to have a chance to drop a Moonstone Fragment if a player mines ores.
Aura XP when killed: 0.5
Walking Speed: 3.5
Running Speed: 4.45
Hostility Radius: 16
Stopping Radius: 0.5
Attack Interval: 1000 ms
Here are a few ways to avoid a Cave Golem’s attacks.
(only inWorlds/Creative) Create an area with a 2-block-high ceiling. Throw Cave Golem Spawn Orbs in the area. Since the Cave Golem is 3 blocks high, it will not be able to move in that 2 block area. Use your weapon to repeatedly hit the Cave Golem. Avoid getting too close as when it may still deal damage. (Note that this is unethical because you would not need to fight off such mobs in Worlds and Creative.)
The Cave Golem has slow movement speed and bad pathfinding AI. They also take damage in lava and spikes. Thus, by creating a wall, spike pit or lava pit, and standing next to the obstacle, facing the golem, the golem would run into the lava or wall, making it very easy to kill and farm for moonstone.
Tower up 4 blocks and shoot them with a bow (someone edit this and make it better)
Frost Golemsare the Frost version of Cave Golems, they do the same amount of damage but applySlownessto their target for 3 seconds.
It is the first mob to naturally spawn in caves.
Many people are making servers about fighting these mobs.
When you get killed by the Cave Golem when it was first added, you used to respawn with your items.
They are the first hostile mob in Bloxd.io.
Cave Golem used to be the strongest mob. Now theDraugr Knightis the strongest.

Chalk looks like concrete but lighter. Regular Chalk has holes that you can only see up close.
This blocks use is basically for building things that need light shaders.
All you need is an Artisan Bench, the regular chalk, and the color dye you need. If you havered tulip/poppy, you make red chalk block. Same for other blocks. If you want to craft a pastel brick, you need 4 of the same colored chalk, 1sandand 1coal. For slabs, you need 2 of the same colored chalk, for colored chalk, and for pastel bricks, you need 2 of the same colored bricks. NOTE: Currently, there is no way to craft the regular chalk. Cannot be found in some gamemodes like OneBlock or GreenVille
This block is a shader for concrete when making fan art.
The plain Chalk block is not a flat color whereas the colored Chalk blocks are.

The new chat box with swear words (names blurred out for privacy).
The old chat box inBedwars(names blurred out for privacy).
The Chat Box is an in-game feature that shows messages that players send. It also shows Tip messages,Code Blockerrors, and code. When using the Chat, it will show your username followed by a " : " to show who sent the message. It is not recommended to swear or use offensive language in the Chat, because other players or the Chat Bot can ban you. If you attempt to send offensive texts, the game will censor them using five asterisks (*****). It also censors words on anyWritables. InSandboxworlds, you also have the option to only send texts to yourTribe, and in otherGame Modes, your team.
Tips are small texts that show up in the chat, by theDevelopers, which help new players with the game mechanics and tips on how to play the game well. These do not fully explain how to play though, so you need to understand Minecraft and Bloxd.io logic for you to understand how to play. You can enable/disable Tips by typing the/toggletipscommandin the chat.
The Chat Box used to be a dark gray box surrounding the texts players sent, but now it is a small gray rounded square surrounding each separate comment players make.
Click the T key on your keyboard, and a text field where you can type will appear. Use the enter key to send messages. You can write whatever you want, except for swears and links to websites. You can type these in the text box, but once you send the message, asterisks ( * ) will show up, replacing the swears and links. There is a limit to how much you can type, so be careful while explaining your whole life story to your best friend.
Click the white bubble with your finger, and a text box where you can type will pop up. Use the enter button on your keyboard (on screen) to enter messages. Word restrictions and limits are the same as on a PC. Sadly, most mobile players cannot do this though.
You can type messages to other players and use commands in the Chat. If you type/help, a text will appear listing all the possible commands except for World Owner commands. Typing/ownerhelpwill show allWorld Owner exclusive commands.You can use//helpto show all WorldBuilder commands. Most mobile players cannot use Chat commands though.
The Chat also shows who joins, leaves and Combat Logs.
If you click tab or the World button (🌐), you will enter a mode where you can send messages to players only in yourtribe. This can be useful in many situations, such as if a player is chasing you and you need help from trustworthy players.
Instead of sending texts to yourTribe, you have the ability to send messages to World, or Seeker/Hider. It is not recommended to send any type of message regarding your location, because if the players who you were chatting to get found, they can go to your location and kill you.
Click on the spam message they sent, and an option menu will appear, select the Report button, and choose Spamming Chat. A Bloxd moderator will then view the report to check if it looks real, if they think so, they will then ban or mute the player who got reported for 24 hours. If you are the owner of the World, then kick them or ban them from your world.
When a player joins a server, a message will show saying "[username] joined". This feature is in everygamemode, even secret ones. If you are the world owner and you join your world, it says "Welcome to your world. See all owner-only commands using /ownerhelp." It is possible to abuse the chat by leaving and joining a World multiple times (spamming), but you will get a kick or a ban.
When a player leaves a lobby, a message will pop up saying "[username] left". This feature doesn't show in every gamemode, inGreenville,Cube Warfare, andOne Block, if a player leaves in these gamemodes, messages showing that they left will not show up.
If you do this, a message will say "Don't send the same message multiple times" to block message spamming.
If you change aCode Block's code, a message will say "Code Block successfully updated" to show that the code did not glitch.
If you input a specific code into theCode Blockthat makes an announcement, and somebody clicks it, a message will show with the player's username, the message you put in, and the color of the message.
Other player'stribesand usernames will also show in a different color than the text they sent.
(PDC= Protected Chunk) A text will show up if you enter another person or tribe's protectors, saying "Entering [username]'s protected chunk." This is to alert you that you are in another player's protected land and that you can't place or mine blocks ( if you place or mine blocks in an another player's protected chunk, it will say "Chunk protected by [ player name ] )". If you leave a protected chunk, it will say the same thing, but Entering is replaced with Leaving. When you enter or leave your protected chunk, the chat will say "Entering/Leaving your protected chunk." This also works when you leave a player's PDC and enter another player's PDC.
If a command fails, it shows an error code in the Chat Box.
Most of the inappropriate words are in English. But it affects other languages ​​that do not have suitable words like Vietnamese. The word "Phuc" in Vietnamese is so similar to "F**k" in English that Vietnamese players cannot say this word and have to replace it with another word.
Inappropriate words in language There are no words considered inappropriate in Bloxd.io that are used a lot in their language, for example in Vietnamese, there is the word "c*c", which is not allowed if it is an inappropriate word. Making the Vietnamese language full of bad words in the game.
It also shows messages that Code Blocks send. (e.g. "[username] completed the parkour!")
"FAQ" (Frequently Asked Questions) is censored in the chat, so it must be typed "F A Q" instead to avoid the censor. This could be due to it sounding similar to “f**k”. This is a problem for most servers, as questions are asked a lot.
The chat always shows who joins a lobby in Bloxd but not who leaves in certain gamemodes likeGreenville, Cube Warfare etc.
The chat UI has been changed many times in late 2024, but not so much in older times.
Some commands, such as/setspawn, only work if you type them in the Chat.
If you try to change something in a protected chunk, a message will pop up saying you can't change blocks in protected chunks.
You can’t send links or type links in the chat or a message will pop up saying you can’t send links.
In the past, there used to be a [L] before player names who were logged in.

--- Page 64: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Cheats_%26_Glitches ---
Cheats are methods of exploiting the game that are done either externally or using in-game features. When you use a cheat, you risk facing a ban if another player reports you. You may also be flagged by the anti-cheat, which may also result in a ban. As such, it is considered unethical and a bad practice to utilise such methods to gain advantages in Bloxd.io.

I humbly ask you keep these sleep glitches in, since I see multiple uses with this, especially for the prison making community, and world builders.
First if you quickly click and use E at the same time on a bed, you can sleep standing.
If you Have A Top Half Bed, then sleep in it, and you can get several glitches. First, some terminology:
Pre-Sleep: before you begin Sleeping. when you go toNaporSleepany effects you have will be cleared, which can make some itemsIntangible
Nap: when you dont sleep for the whole 10 Seconds
Sleep: when you sleep for the whole 10 seconds, if youSleepon a Top Half Bed, you Will go IntoSleep Paralysis
Awake: whenCLIENT: Awake, SERVER: Awake,when you awake, you get teleported to the last position you were awakepre-sleep
Sleep Paralysis:CLIENT: Asleep, SERVER: Awake,in some cases ofSleep Walking, the player will be unable to move or jump, however they can look around, and use the jump button, while in sleep paralysis, the same physic as you standing still are applied, if you update your physics state using items which become intangible (boats, gliders, ect...), you can go intoSleep Walk
Sleep Walk:CLIENT: Awake, SERVER: Asleep, During this state, you cannot place a block without triggering code toAwakeyou
Passive Effectors: Items which can can move you without you needing to walk (Water, Mushrooms, Knockback, ect...)
Interact: Actions Which Update the Server, (placing blocks, Updating UI, Updating Potion Effects ,setting spawn, ect...)
Intangible: When Items Lose their effect so no longer function as intended (boats: Boating,Gliders: Gliding)
Combat logging is an action where a player leaves a Survival World/lobby while he/she is in a fight. This may be done on purpose to avoid being killed or for other reasons such as the player's device shutting down due to low battery. Players who combat log will be killed and drop their items automatically regardless whether the action was deliberate or not. This only occurs inSurvival,Factions, andOpen Worlds.
When a player combat logs, the message below will be shown in the chat:
"[Player name] combat logged and was killed."
X-ray can be used to find underground bases orOres. X-ray texture packs can be found online, as well as on this wiki (ironically). Using an x-raytexture packwill not result in you getting banned, but it is unethical and unfair to other players as you can find all theoreswithout effort(if they're in a cave, since blocks only render if touching air or lava), unlike other players who play the game without an X-ray texture pack.
If you press "W" or arrowing keys in a ladder, and jump in the exact tick where you reached the top of a ladder, you can do an Extra Large Jump. Sometimes, it sends you flying back instead of making you jump high.
Alternate accounts (alts) can be used to farm health points in Hardcore mode, giving you free health points. Alternate accounts can help find hidden players inBedwars. Alternate accounts can also help test damage points or help duplicate items and blocks inGreenville. Some players use them inLifestealto get infinite health points. There are "regular" ways of using alternate accounts such as taking pictures of builds or setting more homes in servers.
You can seeVersionsfor links to the mentioned websites. You can use Firefox, Edge, Chrome, along with other browsers. You can use sites like Crazygames, Poki and Silvergames. Incognito mode on Chrome duplicates these and you can use BlueStacks or virtual machines as well.
Using right click or E on a workbench, furnace, potion table or artisan bench to create the glitch. The glitch appears to be that the when you interact with the utility the inventory showed for few seconds.
Type //set "Moonstone Explosive" (it requires to set positions before typing this command.) and if the builder places it, it dosen't explode considering it a rare block. (Rare blocks cannot be inputed. Instead, builder texts a argument.)
Drinking aSpeed Potion IIwhile flying inCreativeused to make you teleport to the ground. This has been patched.
If you jump off the main course inBloxd Hop, and land before you respawn, you can walk on the map. You will only respawn if you go below a certain y level (depending on the last checkpoint you touched). This works best in Iron Lands or certain areas in Castle Highgrounds.
You can place Guns in Chests. If you switch your Gun, place your current Gun in a Chest, find a way to die, you can get two Guns. You can get all Guns in the same hotbar with this glitch. Having a teammate would be a smart idea for helping to kill you and guard your Chest. This has been patched.
When some players stand into the block you can shoot their arm with a gun, preferably a sniper.
If you shoot someone that is hiding behind a Block near enough with the shotgun, they can still be killed despite there is an obstacle between.
If you craft a Bow in Cube Warfare and switch to your Gun, you can get a "stone helmet" that can never be removed unless the tab is reloaded; it doesn't add up to defenses and even increases difficulty. Each Gun has a different level of blindness. AK47 being less blind, TAR 21 being blind, and M1911 being the hardest one, giving you ONLY 3 PIXELS OF VISIONIF SPRINTING.
Now impossible due to new Bow crafting recipes.
It used to be possible to transfer Items from Cube Warfare Lobbies to other Game Modes. You had to drop your Items on the ground while alone in a Lobby and join a different one. The Items would transfer. This can not be done with Guns as you can't drop Guns, but only with Blocks and Pickaxes. It has maybe been patched because you can no longer start games with just 1 player, however it might still be possible. You need bad Wi-Fi for this to work.
Killing yourself used to also count as a kill in the old Sky Wars game mode. To do this, you will need anything to hurt yourself before jumping into the void. The easiest way was blowing yourself up with Moonstone Explosive with Bomber or Engineer kit, or some other way.
In some game modes (Bed Wars, Murder Mystery, Hide and Seek), the LimeBedis used for ‘play again’. It’s done by pressing E with it on hand. This also works in Sky Wars. With the Disco Kit in Sky Wars, you can get LimeWool. And since most maps have Wood, you can easily craft a Lime Bed. With this, instead of being killed (and the other player getting 5 Coins for killing you), you can just place the Bed and 'play again'. This has been patched by replacing the Wool in the Disco Kit with ColoredGlass.
By eating a Cracked Coconut and leaving you kept your speed, getting infinite speed. However, it didn't stay just in one lobby but whatever lobby you joined you would have speed. IfArthurdid not patch this glitch, you could drink thePotionsSpeed II, Strength II, Defense II, Invisibility, and Regeneration II and when you playedBedwarsyou would have all these effects.
If you go to the map "lego", and if you try to mine the yellow carpet when you get to the middle, everything freezes and you have to refresh the page.
Set vertical chunk load distance to null (dragging the bar all the way to the beginning). Jump into the Void, then while falling, click the square for the chunk load bar to set it back to 2. You will glitch out, and you will keep falling into nothingness, and NEVER DIE! This may restart the lobby though. Or, just leave your chunk load as null and you will just hang there forever. This glitch is still possible with the BEST CASE SCENARIO, where some devices have vertical chunk at null.
Place a block. Then, if your teammate thinks it is a bridge, the player place a block on top. So do this glitch, walk into the blockWHEN YOUR TEAMMATE PLACES THE BLOCK. You will be glitched into the block.
Sometimes when you go to a generator in a Bedwars server, the game will give you a wrong amount of materials, but it won’t be easy to notice until you buy things. You will notice you can’t buy things even though you have the materials to buy it, then shortly after, they will disappear. This makes people confused.
You can jump into the void and die, and when the game starts, you will get bugged out and can't play. This is patched by making the pre-game lobby, so players can't jump down.
You could find an Illegal Block in Isle of Grove orGreenvilleand throw aFireballat theBlock; it will be destroyed, and you can get the Block. Fixed between October 10 and 15, 2023, where allFireballswere removed from players' inventories sadly.
On early August of 2024, someone used press to buy to get fireballs. This was posted by Martin MMC. Shortly after, it was patched. However, these illegal items are still in rotation and have evolved into further items like fireball blocks.
Open two tabs logged into differentGreenvillelobbies and take some items you want to dupe and put them in a chest. Leave the game in the tab you placed the items in first, then the other one. Then, log back into theGreenvillelobby. Your items will be in your inventory and in the chest at the same time. This was patched by not letting you play any two games on two different tabs or even devices.
Recently, Arthur added a feature that re-added the Obsidian below the One Block every time a player rejoins. This is to prevent it from being accidentally destroyed.
This means you can mine the	Obsidian below the One Block (if you have a basement below it), log	off, and then come back to have a fresh new one regenerated.
If you find the process too tiring, grinding to the Volcano phase is also a solution.
Your game can also lag in a different way than FPS dropping. It often happens in One Block if a new update is being released soon. This will cause Grass not	regenerating after you shear it, Flowers not growing and Items, especially Food, to have the wrong textures. Mining Trees will drop Compasses (or other unusual Items like Name Tags and Melon Slices) instead of Fruits. If you try mining your One Block at that time you	might get Cotton instead of Diamonds and Chests will drop wrong-texture Items.
Place these Items into a Chest. Wait for a minute and reopen the Chest. The Items will be turned	back to their true textures. If these Items are Fruits, you might also transform them back to normal by trying to eat them.
Technique used by Technochan, DMARSH, and most likely lasthuman. It's still unknown on how to activate the glitch.
For a long time, when the Detective dies and an Innocent picks the Gun up, this Gun will have infinite ammo (showing “M16 NaN/30”) but deals no damage.
This was fixed after a long time byMattzap. However, this caused Murder Mystery to be almost unplayable for some time.
Around the same time, the Murderer also couldn't kill with their weapon, this was also fixed.
There is also a cheat where jumping from a certain tree onto the baby dino's arm in Jurassic, you can get on top of the map and go almost anywhere, including on top of the lava spurt on the volcano.
InInfection, you used to be able to put a Gun in theChest(the checkpoint where you buy Guns). You would then die, go back to the Chest as a Zombie, and retrieve your Gun from the Chest. Since points were boosted as Zombies, you would be able to 2 shot Humans.
Another way to do this is by dropping the Gun and killing yourself using the void. When you respawn and become a Zombie, pick that Gun up again.
This was patched when they replaced the Chest with Crafting Tables, and fixing that you could drop Guns.
InInfection, you used to be able to get on top of cars. When the game is starting, simply keep flying up, and when the game starts, you would have a boosted jump, and you would be able to get on top the nearest car. This was also possible with using the trapdoors on the cars as ladders.
There is another car glitch where you jumped by the car until a Zombie hit you, then you will be hit onto the car and shoot the Zombies on the car which is really strong since it will be harder for the Zombies to hit you. This only works in the Hospital map.
In Infection, if you place a ton of boats in Extraction Point 3 of Farm (recommended if your a zombie and the humans are on a different obstacle), Then vote the Hospital map then go to Extraction Point 1 and you will find boats on the reception cupboard. Ride one of the boats and break the others inside the cupboard immediately if zombies are starting to swarm the room. This is the best hiding spot and a perfect chance to get 2000+ points (There's a problem because the zombies can break your extra / escape boats (which were the remaining boats outside)).
For whatever reasons, sometimes after killing a zombie, it’ll drop a Aura Xp Orb. Although this gamemode has no experience bar, it still can be consumable. Sometimes this was a prized possession for players who were farming points. This bug is now patched. It might be true in other gamemodes.
InPirates, you were able to take off yourArmor. This was patched by removing the un-equiping of Armor, deterring stealth missions.
Works on Green ship in Treasure Island map, and sometimes Red ship in Cutthroat Cliffs map. Dirty Flea Sack added a feature where you would still respawn if your last Spawn Block was destroyed while respawning, causing you to respawn on Block of Maple Wood Planks instead. However, there is a chance in the two areas mentioned above, you will continue to respawn on Maple Wood Planks in the location of the last spawn Block, even if it was destroyed. This bug would lead to games going forever and was disliked by the community.
It is possible to bypass the CD for Admiral. Place the Artillery Beacon, wait for the Moonstone Explosives, then kill yourself. The CD will still be running, but you will have an Artillery Beacon, which you can place down, call a strike, and bypass the CD. You don't really get to use it too much though if you don't have spawn blocks. Patched, you still get the Beacon upon death but it will say "Beacon on cooldown!"
Sometimes when you’re internet or wifi is very bad, you can swim in the Water, but it does not always work. But BEWARE. You usually will suddenly die if trying to attack the other team’s ship. This can be really bad when your team does not have Spawn Blocks left.
You are sometimes able to get away with one water jump if your ping is ideal.
NOTE: It is very risky to try as you can die because of high ping. It can also only be performed once at a time, since one can only bunny-hop once on water.
It is possible to boost boats very far using knockback potions, or if you are hit by anything.
In thePlotsgame mode, if you throw a Splash Instant Healing or RegenerationPotionat another player, they will switch into Survival mode forever but will still be able to fly. You can then kill them using projectile weapons (e.g., Fireballs). For this glitch to affect yourself, drink a Regeneration Potion.
(note that Prison is a removed game mode so none of the glitches connected with it work regardless of them having been fixed or not)
In Prison, when you join a lobby and earn money, you must constantly leave and rejoin to purchase anything. After you purchase a cell and walk through the wall, you end up in someone else's cell and are able to steal their Items.
When Prison was first released, players were able to TP to others using the /tp command. This means that players can access other's cells or go to the Iron mine without the Inmate+ upgrade. This was patched when it was re-released.
If you manage to get hold of a Sapling of any kind (VERY RARE to drop in Prison Trees), you can do the following things with it:
Put it in your cell and wait for	it to grow. This way, you can get the Saplings and Apples with the	normal loot table. The leaves will also GROW outside the cell.
Used to make others mad. Mine two Blocks down on the border	of the mine, place a Sapling, come back up, and seal up the hole so	no one can see the Sapling growing. A few minutes later, an indestructible Tree will be grown in the mines, blocking any player's path.
This glitch was then fixed in the new Prison game mode by removing any Saplings from the game.
It is possible to spawn with a Sword in hand WITHOUT COUNTDOWN OR CONFISCATION. Move your Sword to the first slot of your hotbar, then rejoin. You will spawn holding the Sword, but the countdown will not start, nor will the Sword be confiscated. However, if you switch hotbar slots or move the Sword, the countdown will start.
Incorrectly jumping off of an ice block may make the player stuck. This is a big problem with many parkour servers.
In any mode,Hang Gliderswill sometimes glitch and make you stuck until you unequip the glider. This is used to get an unfair advantage inRocket Spleef.
Sometimes when you equip a Hang Glider you will not float but just fall like you didn't have the Glider. Fix this by switching to a different slot and back or relocating the Glider in your Hotbar.
Place Water on the second Block of a wall, then spam  press the jump button to jump very high. If you jump in a Water Block, you will jump two Blocks high. Using momentum from the first jump can let you jump up to 5 blocks.
If you teleport to a home which is midair, there is a short period of time that you can jump while midair after teleporting to the home. This can be used to cheat parkour servers in custom worlds.
In Parkour mode, If you have a checkpoint and die, there is a chance you get stuck in the checkpoint block. Trying to move will teleport you back to the same location.
If you shoot a Fireball and a Moonstone Orb at once, so that the Orb touches the ground exactly at the same moment as the Fireball explodes, the Fireball will launch the Orb far up and to the side. You will instantly teleport 100+ Blocks into the air. You can do this more easily by shooting the Fireball and the Orb from a distance. The Fireball travels slightly more slowly than the Orb, giving you more time to switch slots and aim.
If you break a Bed in someone’s protected chunk, they may glitch out and make the Bed longer. You can use this glitch to float in other people's perspectives. Note that this glitch is very old, and won't always work.
Press [O] when not in full screen. You can still move around. Jump off a ledge, then, with your free mouse, click the reload button on the webpage while midair. Do not click "Cancel" or "Reload," just leave the pop-up there. It will freeze you. You will be floating. Do NOT use [CTRL] + [R]; you will toggle full screen. You can also use CTRL+W on the pause screen.
When you crouch at the very top of a ladder (easier against a wall), and hold crouch (possible with toggle crouch, but very difficult), then when you move forward you get launched upwards depending on how long you were there.
Crouch at the top of a Ladder, then press [shift] + [spacebar] + [W] to jump extremely high. However, this only works if the ladder ends 1 block before the top (1 block above the ladder). Place more ladders to jump even higher.
Below are the steps to perform this glitch:
Block hitboxes highlighted with red
Place Laddersone facing towards you and the other one facing towards your left in the Block next to the first Ladder (to the left).Other ladder arrangement optionsshown in the galleryare also available.
Put solid blocksabove/next to (if the Ladder is on the Block you want to launch) the previous placed ladders.
Add a ladder behind the first one.
Place yourself in the cornerof the Ladders aiming at them, thenhold jump key[Space]key by default) andcrouch key([C],[Caps Lock], or[Ctrl]by default).
Wait for about 5 secondsto	gain potential energy to jump on max height.
Press[W]key(default forward key) and quickly release crouch and hold sprint key ([Shift]key by default) (releasing the crouch and pressing sprint is optional, this is just necessary so as not to fly back).
*The jump height has been rechecked many times; both 2 and 3 ladders setups show the same result.
A high jump is also possible from a single Ladder (Trapdoor) in a similar way. The jumping characteristics of single and double Ladders are presented in the following table.
Characteristics of jumping from ladders (trapdoors)
Plum Ladder, Pear Ladder, Aspen Ladder
Ladders will launch higher depending on the time you spend on the ladder.
(Iron Ladder) (2) Time and how high it launches

There are multiple ways the phrase through Blocks and so on, they could be unethical or offensive, so keep that in mind and do not abuse this glitch.
By walking into a transparent Block and leaving the game, when you rejoin, you will be on the highest Block that the game can bring you. (Reminder that the glitch is now half patched and can only put you 1-2 blocks upwards) The Transparency Mechanic is a mechanic that allows you to phase through Blocks above you. It is caused by the game looking higher and higher to find a "safe spot" for you to spawn.
Below is a guide on how to perform this glitch (Note: This glitch does not work inBedwars,Murder Mystery,The Pit,Greenville,One Block,CubeWarfare,Hide and Seek, andDoodle Cube. This is because they do not have available Transparent Blocks or they are a minigame, meaning leaving and rejoining does not spawn you in the same spot, or it makes you spectator mode.
Obtain one Block/Item listed below	and place it. (Skip to step 3 if there's already one nearby.)
Walk into it. You may need to open it to walk in.
Leave the lobby, then rejoin. You will be teleported above all Blocks that were in the way of your	spawn. This is useful for escaping prisons or getting to the terrain from the void in parkour servers.
Note that sometimes you don't need a transparent Block to do	this too.
Trapdoors
Nets
Cobwebs
Ladders
Seeds (any type)
Wheat
Rice
Cranberries
Fallen Leaves
Water
Boards
Saplings
Carpets
Potion Tables
Flowers
Tall Grass
Cactus (the tiny ones you can go through)
Vines
With the block facing the ceiling, climb to the top and throw a Moonstone Orb. You could phase through the ceiling. Then, use another orb to throw onto the top of the ceiling.
This is a really complex one. It is done by being in midair while bonking to a wall, then disconnecting at the perfect time. It does anUpwarp.
Walk into a wall, and as you are walking into the wall, disconnect and rejoin, When you rejoin the lobby, you may find yourself inside the wall. You could set home there, and walk freely in and out. (work when you are walkingWESTorNORTH) (works when no Blocks above wall co-ordinates)
You could clip through walls with a Boat too. Place water then the Boat against the wall, then remove the water in any way. Ride in the Boat then push towards the wall. You could slowly phrase through after a few bounces.
Another way to do this was to ram into a wall with a Boat so that more than half of the Boat was in the wall. Leave the Boat then enter it again. The Boat is now inside the wall.
To glitch through thicker walls, use Moonstone Orbs. You are sitting in the Boat in one Block, while your head is in the Block above. Shooting a Moonstone Orb will teleport your lower part and the Boat into the Block where your head is now, while your head will teleport one Block higher. Using this you could phase through any wall, even Bedrock.
To prevent players from entering your base in this way, make two walls and fill the space between them with Water. As it is impossible to enter a Boat while in a closed room with water, players will get stuck between the two walls.
Place 9 of the block that you want to dupe on the ground in a square formation.
Above the middle block, place amoonstone explosive.
Pick up the dropped blocks and there will be about a 100 of them.
Put the things you want to dupe in yourInventoryand then exitGreenvilleorWorlds(Greenville) and close the tab.
Open 2 tabsBloxd.ioin the browser. Log in to different servers on each tab.
On the first tab, go toGreenvilleorWorlds(Greenville), put in aChestthe things that you want to dupe and exitGreenvilleorWorlds(Greenville),	then close this tab.
In the second tab, immediately exitGreenvilleorWorlds(Greenville) and log back intoGreenvilleorWorlds(Greenville)	without leaving the tab.
We take our things out of theChest.
(Strictly and accurately follow the instructions and you will succeed. Just in case, put at least 1 copy of the Block or item that you want to dupe into anotherChest, in case you fail (bad Internet or you may forget the instructions and do something wrong.)
There is also another way to dupe:
Place a door and a chest on top of each other.
Break them.
Change house.
You get a half door. Put a chest on top of it.
Open the door and change house quickly.
You still get the chest. Repeat this process.
It is patched due to the half doors being patched, making every duper including Melon Dupers be gone.
Create aHalf Bed. Place aChestin the place where the missing part of the Bed should be. Put the Items you want to dupe into the Chest. Leave and rejoin the lobby. Break the Bed. The Chest will break too and drop the Items in it. Collect the Items, leave and rejoin. The Chest will reappear. Open the Chest and take out the Items. You have successfully duped. Could also be done with Tall Grass.
Note: Duping is unfair and destroys the point of playing. Also be careful when duping multiple times in a row as you could get banned for spamming rejoins.
There are two ways:
The game can’t save your builds. If you put an item into the unsavedChestand get it out, you may find your Items in your oldChestand yourInventory, making it duplicate. (patched?)
Join with a bloxd account and use another device with the same account and leave on the first device you joined, you join on	your first and second device that are linked on the same account,	join the same world at the exact same time, this will cause you to join on both the first and second device which you can either kill	or drop the Items to one of the accounts, you must leave on the	account you killed/dropped Items since it saves the Inventory of the account that is still joined. You may get banned permanently without any notice for spam rejoining.
You can sometimes dupe Items by moving Stacks of materials between Chests. Take a stack of any Block or Item from a Chest and open a different Chest. Put the stack in by left-clicking on the stack while holding [Shift]. You will transfer the Items into the Chest, but 1 of the Item may appear in your Inventory. This dupe isn't patched, but it is not particularly useful because you need a lot of the type of Item to create just 1 more and the process is slow and doesn't work often.
If you charge a Bow and put it in your Inventory before releasing it, you will have a glitched Bow with the tag[material] bow|meta|charging 4.This bug has been patched.
This glitch also works with a Crossbow; however, Crossbows are meant to stay charged.
You can drop your meta|charging Item and it will be dropped on the ground as a charged Bow.
You could also fake it withName Tags.
The first way is to put Water on Bedrock and blow it up by Exploding Moonstone Explosive in the Water.
Blow up openedDoorswith a Moonstone Explosive. Then collect the dropped Item and rejoin. After rejoining the lobby, they (the Items) will become no texture, and you can place it on Bedrock, then break theDooror open theDoor.
It is somehow possible to input "`" into the number-only lobby code and join a lobby. This makes the player spawn in an open world, despite the gamemode used.
When you put an item that you want to store inside a salvaging table, via shift click, then hit the number of the slot of the item you want to store, the item you want to store will disappear. Hit that button again to get the item back. It stays inside even if you exit the table or unload the chunk. It transmits across the server so the item can be accessed from anywhere inside the world, but not by other players. Be warned though, the items get deleted when you leave and it can only hold up to a stack (
Here are some .glitches that work withProtectors.
If you place a Block on a wall in a protected chunk, you can jump on the Block before it disappears and climb by repeating this process. (Patched)
In a protected chunk, you can place a Ladder on a wall and still climb it before it disappears and goes back into your Inventory.
This means if you repeatedly place the Ladder, you can climb a wall in protected chunks easily. This glitch is not visible to others, so you might be suspected of hacking. This glitch is similar to the scaffolding glitch in Minecraft.
In a protected chunk, you can break a Block on the ground and walk right into it before it reappears, and half of your body will be stuck inside the Block. However, the developers have mostly patched it.
You can glitch out of the Block simply by moving away.
If the Blocks are sensitive enough, or if you are mining with a really good tool, your whole body will be stuck. Can also be used to walk through walls.
Mining the edge of a protected Block will make the block disappear for longer before it notices and respawns. This glitch is used for escaping prisons or servers where you need to keep in an area.
If you place aWorkbench,Furnace,Artisan BenchorPotion Tablein a protected chunk and right-click on it before it disappears or hold to place it down and then use it, you can use that Block but still walk. You will lose control of the pointer if you do this, so you cannot turn, and your vision will be disturbed. However, it does not always work.
Here are glitches and methods that allow you to x-ray. The main requirement for x-ray is for you to stand so the upper part of your body is inside a Block.
If you crouch to the edge of a Block, you can sometimes place a Block where you are. Walk into this to x-ray.
If you set your home underground, you can x-ray. Move away, put 2 blocks on top of each other in the space you set home in, teleport there, and get x-ray!
If you place Glass directly over Water, you can see through the Water as if it were not there. This can also be used to make invisible barriers and mazes.
Sometimes, when you break Blocks, the Block appears to not be broken. It's called a "ghost Block." If you walk through the glitched Block you can phase into the Block(s), depending on internet ping.
You can use aTexture Packto x-ray.
Grow a tree on yourself. Note that it takes time for aTreeto grow. (note that Bone Meal can bypass this duration so you should get some Bones for Bone Meal by killingDraugr Skeletonfirst and then do the trick)
If you dig down 2 Blocks in a protected chunk, you could get x-ray too, although this only applies to Blocks that can be instantly mined (such asNatural SoilsorGlass.)
Dig a one-block hole on a wall, put a Block of Water in the hole, place aBoat, and right-click on it.
Dig a one-block hole on a wall, throw aMoonstone Orbat the hole.
If you mine quickly with a good tool, you might also get x-ray for less than a second when breaking a Block. This is useful to locate the position of caves in mines and get a glimpse of the ores in it.
If you put lots ofBoardsaround one spot and write Chinese or Japanese characters on them (because it takes up more memory), then let another player near it, they can either get kicked or freeze due to the high amount of RAM needed to process everything in the signs.
If you put lots of Chinese or Japanese Characters (because it takes up more memory) in aBookthen fill a Chest full of these Books you could make a Ban Chest which if opened bans the player because of too much data (theoretical not proven (idea fromMinecraftBan Chests)) or lag that player. It is possible if the other player has a bad-ended device. If you have a decent PC then the game would not crash. (unconfirmed)
Additionally, if you have a book not published, it will corrupt and take data from another book (confirmed).
You can copy books by opening a published book and unpublishing it, switching slots to another book, and exit out. The data will transfer to the new book.
Some projectiles, such as Snowballs and Balls are reusable after throwing. Throw at least 3.5 stacks into a Water Block (let them sink). Build a "chimney" surrounding the Water Block. Then, throw aFireball/Iceballinto the chimney, and it will launch all projectiles in it.
By spam-placing Boats on Water, your FPS can drop significantly. It will drop more if you get in a Boat in the pile or just by going into the center of all the Boats. This is because Boats have a variable that is called "boating" and will be set to true if you right clicked on it. Also, it constantly checks if you are holding aHang Glideror crouching. That should be the main reason for the lag because of all the data each Boat carries and the check each Boat needs to do.
By firing a huge amount ofFireballs or Iceballsinto a two-block tall Water from above the Water, you get a tower of Fireballs/Iceballs. Get rid of the Water, and replace the Water for any Block you want (Glassis suggested since it can let you see where the Fireballs are). Finally, throw one Fireball/Iceball toward the Block where the Fireball was. This will cause a particle effect and lag your game. Furthermore, it will break the sound too, meaning that other noises made near the fireballs/iceballs and even music cannot be heard.
If you mine a Block underground as spawn is reset, you can control the spawn revert by breaking and placing Blocks.
Sometimes when spawn resets, some chunks don't look like they reset. This means if people had created holes in those chunks, you could fall down and then others would not be able to reach you that quickly since it reset for them.
These are glitches that happen connected with the User Interface.
Sometimes your UI will disappear if you press [O] to access the options. This usually happens in PvP gamemodes, especially if more similar things happen at the same time, for example you die and the game ends. Can also happen if you press [O] while you have your Inventory open or are using a Utility Block.
In similar circumstances, especially after dying in a chaotic PvP game, you might respawn already moving or even rotating and unable to stop. This is very annoying and makes the game unplayable as you practically can't move or look in the desired direction. How to fix this:
Try to press the control correlated with the movement. For example, if you are moving forward, try pressing W to fix it. If you are crouching, press Ctrl, and repeatedly jumping press Space etc.
Try pressing [tab] or [O] or using a Utility Block.
If that doesn't help, leave and rejoin the game.
If even that doesn't work, leave the game, refresh the page and rejoin again.
This glitch most often appears in Pirates and Cube Warfare.
inLucky Towerswhen you are in spectator you can get potions effects from other players. The glitch will probably be patched soon though. But it can mean that the spectator could either attack players (if there was a potion called strength 1 or 2). 1.Just be near a player in spectator in Lucky Towers and when they throw a potion down you get the effect.
Since the addition of Code Blocks, you can now add a specific set of code in order to change your Skin* or give you a Cape* (*Note that the effect will wear off if you go to another lobby).
Getting source code items such as Artisan Shears and Toxin Ball are now possible due to the code blocks holding the same format of code as the source code. An unknown player posted the code block into Bloxd Builds, the official schematics website, and now by placing a Potion Table and a Press to Code Board on it, the player can get infinite source code items for Stone.
These glitches requires more complicated stuff and don't use much in-game mechanics.
The easiest way to auto-process is to place something heavy on the key you want to hold. For instance, if you want to auto-walk, you could just place something heavy on the [W] key. Strapping a rubber band around your mouse is a better idea than something heavy, as it may slip off. Note that if you want to do something else while auto-processing on the same device, you would have to use the techniques below.
Hold your finger on a block/button/joystick, and when you start mining it, click the home button/switch to another tab. Then, re-enter bloxd and you will automatically be mining, walking, or jumping.
Alternative method: Face your head towards the lower block in a strip mine hole. Then, tap the left and right sides of your phone at the same time (pretty much both fingers on the block). You should be auto-mining, and now move forward on the joystick. Tap the screen with another finger if you want to stop.
Usually when your WI-FI is very bad, perhaps on your iPad, the game will get glitchy and completely freeze. To fix this, connect to the internet.
Either Hold [W] and press [ESC], or open a new tab in fullscreen, minimize it, hold [W], and press [Alt] + [Tab]. This glitch allows you to walk forever, as long as you don't press WASD again.
This can be combined with auto-mining to auto-strip mine.
Another way is to press F5 while falling no matter you are in full screen or not, though in some computers it doesn’t work.
Note that using F5 to reload the page does not work on the built-in "Enter Bloxd" full screen feature, as it would put you to 3rd person camera.
If you use an invite link and change the number between "?lobby=" and "#g" to any number with more than 16 digits, you will join that lobby. It is now impossible as the game will now just take the first 16 digits and join that lobby.
If you use an invite link and change the number between "?lobby=" and "#g" to any negative number, you will join that lobby. This is not something you can do on the Bloxd.io main menu.
WARNING: These glitches WILL get you banned. USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.
If you place a space between "https" and "://", you can bypass link blocking in the Chat, however you can be reported.
By replacing letters or adding letters, etc, you can bypass the chat filter and say bad words, but you might get reported and banned or muted. Inappropriate usernames have one of the worst punishments.
This is a list of bugs in Bloxd. Different from Cheats & Glitches, these exploits are not caused by the player. Instead, it was created by developer coding problems.
in an open world, like your own world, dig a three block hole. Then, dig at least one block ahead of you. Glide in to the blocks to x-ray!
Hang Glidersused to be able to go through 1 block and give you x-ray vision, however, this was fixed not long after.
Moonstone Explosiveused to spawn in the Spawn location inSurvival. This bug has now been fixed.
You can collect block-breaking items (e.g.Fireball and Iceball,Moonstone Explosive, etc.) inDoodle Cubeand destroy people's walls and their "work" after a major update inDoodle Cube.
Grenade Blockwas a broken update block inGreenvilleand it is aBlockthrown from theGrenade Launcher in Rocket Spleef. The cause of this bug is due to an oversight with the yellow concrete slab from a recent update adding concrete slabs into the game.
There is a chance that the mouse will not get detected, making breaking blocks andPvPa big problem. (This is caused when your mouse pointer exits the screen, thus rendering you unable to turn your head. This is caused by the player and is therefore a “Glitch”.
Finding short-ish, tall-ish grass inSurvival,Peaceful, andCreativeand placing a bed on it, then breaking the grass creates a half bed glitch.
Some tall grass near spawn generates with only the top part.  (fixed?)
If you useapi.setPosition()in a world (like this:api.setPosition(myId,x,y,z)wherex,y, andzare the x, y, and z positions you want to teleport to respectively, andmyIdstands for your temporary entity ID, as the player is an entity) where you have access to code blocks and use the code to go 33554432 then 67108864 blocks away from 0,0 in both or one direction, you will notice parts of the world and even your placed blocks repeat and terrain starts to glitch; at 16777216 blocks, half the blocks do not exist but are shown. If you could move, then you would be stuck in a straight line (for teleporting in one direction) or one block (for teleporting in both), like in the video gameMinecraft:Bedrock Editionwith their Stripelands (the non-existent blocks do not show) (Java Editionhas the same problem but is beyond its world border at 30,000,000 blocks). This is due to a phenomenon in computers from using any type of floating point precision (with different numbers for the bug) where the larger the number, the less accurate the precision. This is also why decimals like 0.3 show as a slightly less precise interpretation (0.30000000000000004) because it uses binary, which is where numbers are in 0s and 1s, and binary goes infinitely for some decimals not made from negative powers of two. Furthermore, going above 2^15 y (or 32768), setting a block with WorldBuilder, and jumping in survival world becomes buggy due to the same binary and floating point precision as well.
If you set home above a solid object and cover your home with blocks, you will get x-ray and you can see through rock and spot caves.
An example of how the broken reported UI looks.
There was a bug, where if you try to report someone the only option is Stealing/Scamming/Griefing, no matter what they did.
Dupe Bookshelf Error: You need to have Bookshelf Empty and 1 book, press E or right click continuously, Bookshelf Empty will drop continuously.
Unable to create vertex buffer.
Friend System may freeze at times like after some update or some other reasons, and may display 0 friends and friend requests.
When your friend is rowing, hit the boat, the boat of that friend and your friend will fly and may freeze.
When you right click a cactus with a bucket, it gives lava instead of water.
Grenade (bug update block) has the in-game name item:grenade and this block can formerly only be collected with amoonstone pickaxe. (Can now be collected with any pickaxe)
After the One Block dupe bug was patched, another dupe bug appeared by players (hard to explain so can't give instructions) and the bug was also discovered and fixed by developers.

To open a Chest, right-click on it. Then grab the Items in one slot of the Chest/Inventory and move them to a slot in the Inventory/Chest. You can also [shift]+click on a slot to move all its Items to the first available slot in the Chest. You can also right-click while holding some Items above an empty slot to only place one of this Item in this slot.
If you want to close a Chest, click outside of the Chest UI. The Chest will also close if someone else opens it while you have it opened. You can move around with an open Chest, but your vision will be obscured by the Chest UI. Recently a feature was added that you close the Chest if you get hit by another player.
A Chest offers the same space as yourInventoryif you don’t count your hotbar.
If you place a Name Tag or a Book inside a Chest and break the Chest, the Name Tag or Book will reset.
If you place a renamed Item into a Chest and break the Chest, the Item name will change back to its default name.
If you place a Compass in aChestand destroy the Chest, the Compass will reset its coordinates to (0,0,0).
2 or more players cannot use the Chest at the same time, first come, first served, but when another player uses it, the first user will be kicked out of the Chest.

A Grass Block is a naturalBlockthat generates all across the surface of Open Worlds, it’s also one of the most common blocks.
Grass Block is a green Block with light green patches.
A Grass Block can be obtained the fastest by just using aSpadein PlainsBiomes, Forests, and the bottom of mountains.
A Forest Biome.
By just simply using Shears, players can obtain a Grass Block from the Block itself by right-clicking on a Grass Block. The Grass Block will then turn into Dirt and will grow back into a Grass Block later. This makes Grass Blocks infinitely renewable. It will also drop a Grass Block which you pick up and in this way it’s basically farm Grass Blocks. This can be used to expand players'One Blockislands faster, and it can also be used as an infinite Grass Block farm. However- Dirt itself will never turn into a Grass Block no matter what, even if it is touching a Grass Block. This also means that if you need urgent Blocks, you could get lots of Dirt with one Grass Block. (Place a Grass Block, shear it, mine the Dirt, place the new Grass Block you obtained, shear it again ...)
After shearing Grass Blocks, the Grass Block turns into a Block that, in the game’s files, is called Dirt|GrassRoots. This Block drops Dirt when mined. Only Dirt|GrassRoots will ever turn into Grass Blocks.
Grass blocks generate naturally all across the surface of Forests and Plains in thee Open Worlds.
There are also Blocks called Grass and Tall Grass that are transparent Blocks. You can use them to produce/make Wool, Green or Light-Green armor or Wood. They sometimes drop Wheat Seeds when mined. To obtain them, use Shears to mine them.
For more Information gohere
Dirt is a Block that is very common, as it is found in most biomes.
Dirt block
Dirt is a brown Block with tan patches.
The best way to obtain Dirt is to mine it with a Spade. Also, by using Shears (RMB) on aGrass Block, you get a Grass Block  and a Block of Dirt. Mine it before it regrows into a Grass Block. You can also just mine it with your hand. You don't need a tool to mine Dirt really.
Dirt is found in mostBiomes, in the layer under Grass Blocks or under Snow in snowy biomes.
You can also find Dirt in the sides of mountains up to a certain height.
A mountainside
Although crafted from Dirt, you can find Rocky Dirt in mountains.
Dirt can be crafted into Rocky Dirt and Messy Dirt in theArtisan Bench.
Desert
Sandis aBlockthat is used for decoration. It can be crafted into decorative Blocks, smelted into Glass or Bottles, making it an important requirement forPotions. It can also be used to farmCacti.

Go into a Desert and mine Sand with your fist or with aSpade(if you want). Each Block drops one Sand. They also spawn in riverbeds or banks too.
For more information on Sand gohere
Red Sand is an alternative for Sand. It is a reddish-orange and is used for making Red Sandstone Blocks.
A Red Desert

Find a Red Sand Desert (which is rare) for Red Sand.
For more Information on Red Sand gohere
A Snowy PlainsBiome
Snowis another Block that is used for decoration and building, as they are the only purely white Block (except for Quartz, but that is an illegal Block) besides WhiteConcretein the game.
Go find a Snowy Plains Biome or find a high mountain, as they spawn on the ground in the Snowy Plains Biome, while they spawn above y=80 on mountains. Mine it with your fist or with a Spade.
Ice is a Block that generates on top of Water in Snowy Plains biomes. Moving on Ice makes you go faster than on normal Blocks.
Find a Snowy PlainsBiomewith a river. There should be Ice on top, unless someone already took it. Mine with aPickaxe.
Ice Block as it looks when placed
Ice can be crafted into Ice Bricks and Ice Bricks can be crafted into Ice Bricks Slabs.
a Block of Clay.
Clayis another Block used for decoration and is required for crafting Blocks likeConcrete, Bricks, and Ceramic.
Clay is found in Riverbeds and Lakes.
Chalkcan be sometimes be besides clay. It can be used for colorful chalk.
Looks like a white Block with even brighter patches that are barely visible.
Chalk can be found at the bottom of Riverbeds and Lakes, just like Clay.
Cactigrows four Blocks tall instead of three when it is placed on Red Sand.

Coal Oreis a mineralBlockthat drops 1 Coal when mined with any Pickaxe except a Moonstone Pickaxe. With the Moonstone Pickaxe you will obtain a Coal Ore as a Block.
Coal Ore will naturally spawn between 40 and -60 on the y-axis, and there is a 0.5% chance that the Stone in this interval will be replaced with Coal Ore. After this, Coal Ore will try to spawn again within 3 Blocks of the generated Coal Ore. There are at least 4 Blocks between two Coal Ore deposits. Coal Ore has veins of at least 5 Blocks and a maximum of 18 Blocks. Coal Ore will still stand out against Andesite, Diorite, and Granite.
Coal Ore as a Block is used for Building and Decoration.

Cobwebs look similliar like a white striped spider cobweb, and it`s also a recolor of nets with the color white.
Cobwebs look the same as on the default texture pack.
Cobwebs look similliar as on the default texture pack except the middle circle is bigger and looks like a target.
Cobwebs look the same as on the default texture pack.
Cobwebs look the same as on the default texture pack.
Cobwebs look similliar as on JamBloxds but the pixel are arranged different ways.
Cobwebs can be found in ruins structures, with about 0-2 in each ruin. Before ruins were added, you couldn't collect Cobweb, there were only a few ways to collect it like a bug, you could only collect it in the Creative Menu.
You cannot craft with Cobwebs
Cobwebs can be used to slow down another player when walked into.
You can use Hang Gliders to walk through them without the effect of slowness.
You can break cobwebs pretty easily with just your hand (in the game)

Coconutsare Projectiles that can be thrown to turn them into cracked coconuts.
Cracked Coconutsare consumables that can give 8 seconds of speed when eaten.
Go to a Jungle biome, as you can seehere, the forest with mostly Jungle Trees and some Palm Trees, plus some Mango Trees. Then break the leaves of the palm tree with your fist or a hoe. They will have about a 9% chance to drop a coconut for every leaf broken.
Coconuts are usually used for making Speed Potions or making Cracked Coconuts to drink for speed. You can drink a Cracked Coconut to make a Splash Speed Potion and splash it when in PvP to escape whoever is attacking you. Take note that the person attacking you may also get the Speed Boost so getting a Speed Potion (Not a Splash Potion) might be better (But will require some time to drink).

--- Page 72: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Code_Block ---
Code Blocksare special blocks usable only by world owners in Bloxd.io. When a player clicks a Code Block (or a nearby “Press to Code” board), it executes custom JavaScript code that can interact with the game through the Bloxd API. This allows players to build unique interactions, like jump pads, teleporters, or custom effects using Bloxd.io’s API. Code Blocks differ fromWorld Code, which runs globally in response to game events (likeonPlayerJoinortick).

7Limitations of Code Blocks
8Code Block vs Code Board
9Tips:
10Trivia
Code inside a Code Block runs whena player clicks the blockor an adjacent Code Board.
Each block runs its own code separately and resets every time it’s used (no saved variables).
Only theworld owneror users with "canEditCode = true"can edit them.
Code Blocks are unbreakable unless you're increative mode.
When you write code in a Code Block or World Code and run it, it executes in aJavaScriptdesigned specifically for Bloxd.io. This means it uses JavaScript syntax, but only has access to a limited set of game-specific functions and variables. You can't usewindow,setTimeout, or most browser features—but youcaninteract with the world and players using theapiobject.
These are available automatically in every script:
myId: The player ID of the person triggering the code (usually via right-click). This is also similar toentityIdwitch works for players and mobs!
thisPos: The[x, y, z]position of the current Code Block or Board running the code.
Code runs inisolationwitch means any variables you create will reset after the block finishes.
Comments must use/* comment */. Single-line// commentsdon’t work as of now.
Debug output can be printed using:api.log("Debug message") or console.log("Same effect").
Avoid usinglet,const, or globalvardeclarationsoutside of functions, or the code might not work.
Theapiobject contains all functions you can call in your Code Blocks or World Code. Since It’s SO HUGE, here’s a categorized breakdown of a few API's to help you find what you need quickly.
Can control player movement, pose, and visibility.
api.setVelocity(playerId, x, y, z)
api.applyImpulse(playerId, x, y, z)
api.setCameraDirection(playerId, [x, y, z])
api.forceRespawn(playerId)
api.setPlayerPose(playerId, "zombie")
api.setPlayerOpacity(playerId, 0)
api.kickPlayer(playerId, "don't misbehave >=(")
Can send messages to players or everyone.
api.sendMessage(playerId, "hi!", { color: "cyan" })
api.broadcastMessage("No!", { color: "red" })
api.sendFlyingMiddleMessage(playerId, ["cya!"], 120)
Can get/set player or block positions and properties.
api.getPosition(entityId)
api.setPosition(entityId, x, y, z)
api.setBlock(x, y, z, "Gold")
api.getBlock(x, y, z)
api.setBlockRect(pos1, pos2, "Stone")
Can read and control health, damage, and death.
api.getHealth(entityId)
api.setHealth(entityId, 20)
api.applyHealthChange(entityId, -5)
api.killLifeform(entityId)
Can manage inventory slots and item counts.
api.giveItem(playerId, "Dirt", 1)
api.removeItemName(playerId, "Maple Log", 2)
api.getHeldItem(playerId)
api.setItemSlot(playerId, 0, "Stone")
api.clearInventory(playerId)
Can edit chest contents and crafting recipes.
api.getStandardChestItems([x, y, z])
api.setStandardChestItemSlot([x, y, z], 0, "Apple")
api.editItemCraftingRecipes(playerId, "Toxin Ball", [...])
api.resetItemCraftingRecipes(playerId, "Toxin Ball")
Can create Particles, icons, and helper overlays.
api.playParticleEffect({ type: "smoke", pos: [x, y, z] })
api.sendTopRightHelper(playerId, "bolt", "Woah!", { color: "green" })
api.progressBarUpdate(playerId, 0.6, 1500)
Useful for miscellaneous helpers.
api.log("Hello world!")
api.now()
api.checkValid(entityId)
Launches the player straight up upon clicking the block.
api.setVelocity(myId, 0, 12, 0)
Gives a diamond when clicking the block
api.giveItem(myId, "Diamond", 1)
Heals the player by 10 HP when clicked.
let hp = api.getHealth(myId)
api.setHealth(myId, hp + 10)
Hurts players standing on the top of the block.
let [x, y, z] = thisPos
for (const id of api.getPlayerIds()) {
let [px, py, pz] = api.getPosition(id)
if (Math.abs(px - x) < 1 && Math.abs(pz - z) < 1) {
api.applyHealthChange(id, -10)
}
}
Spawns a blue bubble explosion above the block.
let [x, y, z] = thisPos
y += 1
api.playParticleEffect({
dir1: [-1, -1, -1],
dir2: [1, 1, 1],
pos1: [x, y, z],
pos2: [x + 1, y + 1, z + 1],

You can replace"bubble"with other textures like:bubble, critical_hit, drift, effect_5, generic_2, glint, soul_0, square_particle
If you are running in some coding issues, here's some stuff that might help you with fixing your code
Use/* comments */.// commentsdon't work!
Useapi.log("test")orconsole.log(...)to debug.
Avoidlet,const, orvarin global scope.
Wrap your code in a function if you need variables to behave properly. A proper example for that could look like this:
(() => {
api.log("This code should work proprely!")
})()
The skins that are currently accessible are the following: IronMelon, Wizard, FireWizard, Zombie, TraderOne, TraderTwo, TraderThree.
You can get Capes withoutSuperRankif you place down certain code, similar to the custom skins code but shorter. The Capes that are currently available through this exploit are: Super, YouTuber, Pig, Sheep. Unfortunately, this was patched for non-Super Rank users
There are currently 3 known ways to get source code items (or illegal items) in Bloxd.io using code boards or code blocks:
Keep these in mind:
Code Blocks reset every timethey're used. No saved memory or global state.
No persistent variablesbetween uses.
Async functions (e.g.,await) are riskyand may behave unpredictably.
Only the world owner(or users withcanEditCode = true) can place or edit them.
You can’t use browser APIslikesetTimeoutorfetch.
UseBlocksfor most logic — they’re more powerful.
Use aBoardto trigger aBlockinvisibly.
UseBlocksto save code space or create custom items
Press to code boards didn't get announced anywhere and were randomly added byTom, one of the game's developers
Before code blocks were added, there was literally zero documentation on any APIs in the game. Players had to discover it themselves and make it work and was later added with code blocks.
There is only a 16x6 space to write codes in boards. (Not counting Press to code message on top). In total that's only 96 characters!
When code blocks were added, there used to be a glitch where you could open up the code block menu by editing a board somehow. (It really work: place board in space privated by other player (protectors) and you will see the glitch (but you cant edit it 😥))
When World Code was 1st introduced, there used to be a glitch that lets anyone that owned a lobby from everygamemodesget access to World Code (by pressing F8). This allowed alot of users to get illegal blocks in gamemodes they were never able to (notablyGreenville).
The name 'Code Block' may be an easter egg/reference to the Microsoft program by a similar name 'Code Blocks'. ￼
All the other info that you need to know about coding is found in the GitHub repository. You can access ithere!

Teleportation is a very important feature of Bloxd.io. It allows players to travel from point A to B in an instant. Below are some commands with this feature.
/spawn- Teleports the player back to (0, 0, 0), or the location that the spawn is set at.
/tprequest [playerName?]- Sends a teleportation request to the chosen player.
/tpaccept[playerName?]- Accepts a teleportation request sent from another player. This command is especially useful when multiple people are sending request to you.
/tpdeny- Denies a teleportation request sent from another player.
Homes are places that a player set so they can teleport to them whenever they want to. Homes are replaced at the players location they are at if the player uses the same name a home is already named with that name.
/home (name?)- Teleports a player to a home they set.
/delhome (name?)- Deletes the specific home the player chose.
/sethome (name?)- Sets a home at the location the player is standing at. If no name is given, then the home's will appear as empty in the shop.
/homes- Shows the names of the homes that the player has set.
If you meet someone that is doing things that you do not like, you can safely avoid them using the commands below.
/ignore [playerName?]- Blocks or Unblocks the unwanted player's messages in the chat, and prevents the blocked player from requesting a tp request to whoever blocked them.
/report [playerName?]- Reports the player using the in-game chat reporting system. The report will then be reviewed by a Bloxd.io moderator.
There are also severalcommandsthat are useful when you are trying to do certain things, like locating your lost Protector.
/players- Lists all of the players currently online in the chat. This command is now obsolete due to the addition of the [G] key function.
/protectors- Shows the coordinates of all Protectors placed by the player.
/timetillreset- Every two hours that at least one player is on a certain lobby, the 384 * 800,000 * 384 area around spawn resets. This command shows the time remaining until the area resets.
These commands are only used for owners of worlds. Clickhereto see a list of them.

There are a few commands that don't work.
If you try to use any non-existent commands in Murder Mystery, you will receive a message saying: "Command not recognized. Try /home to teleport home". This /home command doesn't work however, as there are no homes in Murder Mystery, it is probably a glitch.
/hide doesn't work in Evil Tower and BloxdHop even though it is an existent command. To do so, press [F] instead.
If you try using non-existent commands in Plots, you will get the following message: Command not recognized. Try out "ping [message]". However, this doesn't work and is probably a glitch.

Acompassis anitemused to point to the coordinates a player has set it to point to. It is created byStardue.
The compass has a black ring surrounding a gray ring. In the middle is where the needle is in a dark gray area.
In thecreativemenu, the compass has its needle pointing down.
Normally, the compass' needle points toward the coordinates (0,0,0). The compass points to the set point when the player holds it in their hand. When off-hand, the compass' needle will freeze.
When a player right-clicks with the compass, it will send a chat message saying 'Set compass target to current position (x, y, z)' and start pointing toward the block the player is standing on when the compass was right-clicked on.
InSky Wars, when 7 minutes past, every player gets a compass, pointing towards the closest player alive to minimize wins for people hiding.
Also, when there are only 2 players left the same occurs.
InSurvival Royale, all players are given a compass when the game starts. It points to the nearest player alive and tells you whether the targeted player is above you or below you.
InPirates, you get a compass when the other team loses all their spawn blocks, you could track enemies with the compass. Also, with the navigator kit, you get a compass that tracks the nearest spawn block.
An Alternative for the compass is thecommand"/sethome". However, homes are limited, and compasses can be used differently.
there is absolute directions in the game, if you set a compass at 0.0.∞ you will have absolute directions
this is needed as some features or glitches work in absolute directions
The compass needle can point in 12 different directions.
InOne BlockandPrison, it is impossible to have a compass with custom coordinates, though you can still craft one.
The compass is useless in othergamemodesthat do not include survival, peaceful, creative,PiratesandSkywars.
Sometimes the compass will malfunction while pointing at its default coordinates (0,0,0)
The compass cannot be stacked meaning it can be renamed with anametag.
If you place a Compass in achestand destroy the chest, the compass will reset its coordinates to (0,0,0).

There's an extra inventory action which is easy to do it: you can switch blocks in inventory to hotbar without dragging. In order to do it, your mouse pointer should hover on a specific item and press a number key representing the item slots in a hotbar (the squares).
Change the control for breaking Blocks/damaging players to any other key except the default LMB. The "Select Item in Inventory" control isn't customizable and will remain bound to LMB. This will allow you to break and hit with the custom key while at the same time use your Inventory or any Utility Block with your mouse. You can also walk at the same time but you can't turn around.

Creativeis a sandbox gamemode where you can build anything from pixel art to incredible builds, and more. It is a sandbox gamemode where the player has the freedom to explore the infiniteopen World. If you really want to only build,Plotsis a great idea with its super-flat design. However, if you want to build with nature and blend your build into the world, Creative is a better choice.Fireballs,Iceballs, andMoonstone Explosiveare banned in this gamemode for the destruction and lag they make. But you can use them in Open Worlds.Protectorsare earned by placing and breakingBlocks. You can have a max of 8ProtectorsAnd 4Tribe Protectors. You can also teleport to fresh land if the land around you is too messy.
To get Protectors andFaction Protectors, you must break or place Blocks. Below is a list of the number ofBlocksyou must break or build to unlock a Protector.
The Start of the Creative Menu.
There are currently Over 550BlocksandItemsavailable in the Creative menu. Access it by pressing [tab].
The menu includes all the legal Blocks and Items people can craft in Open Worlds.
The Creative menu includes Bedrock and Full Bookshelves, which are otherwise unobtainable normally.
The menu includes Fireballs, Iceballs and Moonstone Explosive. You can take them from the menu into your Inventory and/or hotbar, but you normally can't place or use them because they are banned from the gamemode. However, if you are in Creative mode as the owner of yourWorld, you can also use them. Even so, usage of Moonstone Explosive is limited with a cooldown as to prevent spamming.
All Saplings are available in the Creative menu. Planting them in big quantities is limited with a short cooldown due to the huge mess they can make if spammed.
If you just scroll through the menu, you will not find Beds of any other colour except Lime and you won't find dyed Wood Armor. If you want to get these, you must type a key word into the Search option at the top of the menu. E. g. type "Bed" and you'll get a list of all available Beds.
There are Moonstone Orbs in the menu. Their usage is unlimited and they don't deal damage because there is no health bar in Creative.
Once you hold a Block in your hand, you can place it but it won't disappear from your hand. (except theLucky Towersgamemode`s gold platform) Holding left click in creative speeds up block breaking over time.
There is a Pick Block command available only in Creative and Plots. This allows you to instantly get the Block you need into your hand. Aim at a placed Block in your vicinity and press the right control ( default are MMB and [Alt]+LMB ). The Block will be duplicated into your hand. If there is already a Block of this type in your hotbar, you will automatically switch to the slot with this Block.
When breaking any Block in Creative, the Block will not drop but completely disappear. However, if the Block contains any Items, those Items will drop.
Breaking aChestwill drop its contents.
Leaves will dropFruitand Saplings.
Grass and Tall Grasswill drop Wheat Seeds.
Melons and Watermelonswill drop Slices.
Mailboxeswill dropBooks.
Bookshelves will drop Books IF they are partially filled before breaking OR if they have been filled with Books by hand.
Full Bookshelves will drop Full Bookshelves ONLY if they have been taken directly from the Inventory and placed, then broken before any Books have been taken out/put in. When breaking many of these Full Bookshelves, they will not drop each in the place where it had been before broken, but all Bookshelves will merge into one drop. This is most probably aglitch.
In Creative, available utilities include:
Teleport to lobby spawn
Request teleport to a player
Set/Delete/Teleport to a Home
Create Tribe (free)
Teleport to fresh land ( find a new place to build far away from other players)
Creative takes place in an Open World, just likeSurvival,Peaceful,FactionsandBingo.
Creative is the second sandbox/open-world mode to be added.
The only way forArthurto remove protected inappropriate pixel art and builds is to wait for their Protectors to disappear.
There are currently 561 Items and Blocks available in the Creative menu.

If you die, then you lose all your Points. You can buy one Powerups for every tier, priced at 100, 200, and 300 Points each. For a variety, there are seven Guns you can choose from. This game mode could previously only be played by people on desktop, but after the Bows and Crossbows Update update,Arthuradded controls for Guns as well as Projectiles, which is an Arrow. Game modes currently come in 2 types: Free for All and Teams.
Below is a list of guns you can get in Cube Warfare(SeeGunsfor more info.):
AK-47
MP40
M16
TAR-21
M1911
AWP
Double Barrel
(In Coins)
You earn 1 Point for each damage you deal. This means you get a maximum of 100 Points per kill. You can buy upgrades with the points. You can only buy 1 upgrade of each tier. The upgrades stay only as long as you are alive. When you die, the upgrades will disappear upon respawning.
You earn 1 Coin for each kill. Kill stealing still gives you the Coin. Coins don't disappear when you die or when a new round starts.
It is a FFA (Free-For-All) or Teams Shooter. You spawn in a map and fight there. Your initial Inventory contains 1 Gun, 10 Messy Stone and 1 Iron Pickaxe.
There are 4 maps: Nuketown (with 2 different variations), Round-a-bout, and Snowscape.
The leaderboard shows how many Points were achieved by who in the last day, week or all time. The top ranking scores are suspiciously high (around 1-2 full kills per second would be needed to achieve those)
Below is a list of bugs in the gamemode.
No damage:Sometimes when you spawn in the game, you can't deal damage to other players, but they can. This is probably the most annoying bug. This may be caused by your mouse being outside the window of the game.
Shooting throughBlocks. Players can shoot you throughBlockssometimes if they are standing on or are next to the Block. This glitch mostly occurs when using Double Barrel.
You could place Guns inChests, allowing you to have multiple Guns in yourInventory. (Fixed)
In the most recent update, the score board is glitched.
The "Time till next round" glitches to change to a really big number during the 10s of time.
You could craft spikes in certain maps to trap enemies, upon placing, they become unbreakable.
Cube Warfare was the first gamemode to be added to the original three.
Cube Warfare was the first gamemode to haveGuns.
When holding aGunand going into third person, you will see that the camera is changed.
Cube Warfare has not gotten many updates, apart from thumbnail changes and other minor updates.
The most recent update added a new Gun, named the AWP which is a sniper rifle.
Cube Warfare used to be called CubeWarfare, before it was changed to Cube Warfare. This is similar to EvilTower, DoodleCube, OneBlock and BloxdHop becoming Evil Tower, Doodle Cube, One Block and Bloxd Hop respectively.
The thumbnail of this mode was changed on May 1, 2024. Survival mode also changed its thumbnail the same day.New ThumbnailOld Thumbnail
The height limit in Cube Warfare is 22y.
On May 23, 2024, a map was added to Cube Warfare that features Block of Diamond towers on the outside of the map. However, those Block of Diamonds were removed to balance the game as players could create Diamond Armor using them.
If you use your fist to mine something but switch to yourGunright in the middle of breaking a Block, the breaking particles will keep spawning. This can be stopped if you switch out of yourGun.

16 January, 2025: Added to Bloxd.io, it is in a gamemode vote againstOne Block Wide
15 March 2025: Removed from Bloxd.io
Thegamemodeis played in rounds, with the teams switching roles every four rounds. The first team to win five rounds wins. At the beginning of each round, you receive some Coins. Each round you receive more Coins, until the roles are switched.
The spike planter has 60 seconds to plant the Timed Spike Bomb, and has to defend it for 30 seconds before it detonates.
The spike breaker has 60 seconds to defend the bombing site and destroy the Timed Spike Bomb in 30 seconds if it was planted.
The round ends in any of these circumstances:
The Planters don't plant the Spike in time and the Breakers win.
The Planters plant the spike, but the Breakers break it and win.
The Planters plant the Spike and the Breakers don't break it in time so Planters win.
A team kills all enemies and wins the round.
When a team reaches 5 rounds won, the team wins. A team also wins if all opponents leave the game. There are no rewards for winning.
If the player who is carrying the Spike dies, the Spike will drop, but only members of the Planters team can pick it up. Guns will drop from the Inventories when players are killed, but they can't be picked up and used by others. It works similarly to Death Notes inMurder Mystery.
You can access the Shop by right-clicking at the Shop NPC that can be found in each team's base. You start with an M1911, but you can spend your Coins to buy better Guns and other Items. Coins you don't spend this round will stay when the next round starts, but disappear at the end of this game.
When you buy a Gun, you will keep it as long as you don't die. You die if an enemy shoots you, but also if you plant the Spike and are too near to it when it explodes. Your Gun will disappear when the roles are switched and when a team wins.
Wool can be used to hide the Spike after it has been planted.
The map features statues of the Upgrade NPC fromBedwars, or the black wizards.
The gamemode has near-identical game mechanics withCounter-Strike.

Moonstone Axe, obtained before it was deleted from the game files in 2022. It was however, added back as a rebranded item two years later.
Red and Brown Mushroom Block, used to be 2 of the illegal blocks in Bloxd.io (Greenville), but in 2024 it is obtained by crafting with Red or Brown Mushrooms.
Wither Rose (Shadow Rose now), Formerly known as Wither Rose, it is a black flower, illegally collected in the Greenville game mode, similar to other flowers it can be propagated. But after the Frozen Badlands update on May 2, 2025, Wither Rose was renamed to Shadow Rose, collected in the Frozen Badlands biome.
Dim Lamp On, or Blocker, is the firstItemto be added to the game, since they are used inBloxd hop, which is the firstgamemode.
SomeFlowers, such asForget-me-notandAllium, are illegal inGreenville: you cannot get them in Flower Packs. Bluebells are obtained by going to the woodcutting station and harvesting them.
IllegalFlowerscan still be produced as you can farmFlowersusing a square of tilled soil filled in.
Some of theItemshave been found by the players with the help ofglitches.
Mushroom Blocks (Red Mushroom and Brown Mushroom) are no longer an Illegal Item as of May 17, 2024. However,Red and Brown Mushroomsremains illegal inGreenvillebecauseMushroom blocksare Illegal there.
Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks were previously Illegal Blocks.
Because CyanCeramichas aMinecraftCreeper face on it,Arthurcould not add this block to the game, as it would be illegal. However, JanuaryBoy, known as JanuaryBloxd in YT, changed the texture of the block and may have notified the devs or posted on Discord, since it was added on July 6, 2024.
Mushroom Stem is not an illegal block in Greenville as you can get Mushroom Stem in theGreen Mushroom houseand theRed Mushroom House.
Moonstone Axe, Artisan Axe, and Artisan Shears were each in the game for a few days but were later removed.
Barkless Logs used to be illegal, but now they were changed so you can right click a log with an axe to get some. Before that was added, getting Barkless Maple Logs and Barkless Aspen Log inGreenvillewas probably done by blowing up the Woodcutting house with aFireball.
There used to be a bug that Maple Barked Log isn't in the creative menu. The only way to obtain before was chopping the barks of the log. (If your a World Owner and your in Creative, switch gamemode to Peaceful and do the way this trivia entry told. Then bring back your creative.)
Invisible Solid can't mined. It always regenerates right before you would mine it. Only way to break it is withMoonstone Explosive, so careful when placing! Probably it is breakable inCreative, just likeBedrock. Probably with new texture packs added in the game, just useSimpleBetterto break it, Then change your texture pack and put it. (don't put in wrong way again!)
The Block of Emerald and the Block of Lapis Lazuli are secretly hidden in towers near Aspen Forest in theGreenville(Isle of Grove) gamemode.
The Water block can be obtained inSky Warsby repeatedly using a filled water bucket.
Gravel and Yellowstone can be collected inOne Blockas you can collect them in different phases.
Cobweb is no longer an illegal item afterMysterious Ruinswas added to the game.
Cobweb, Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks are no longer illegal blocks.
With the addition to Press To Codesigns& Code Blocks and some new API's, you can now obtain every single illegal blocks within ownedWorlds.
UnlikeFireball and Iceball, Toxin Ball has no firing limit.
If you want some items with this symbol (|), then use it between the crop stages (ex. Rice|FreshlyGrown). The symbol for this is called the vertical bar.

Illegal Blocks(admin blocks) are a secret or an easter egg to the game, some are used in game modes, or some are used secretly. You may also find illegal blocks in public servers.
SomeIllegal Blocksare very hard to obtain. It is almost impossible to obtain these items in many gamemodes. Most(If not all)illegal blockscan be obtained in worlds(that you own) usingCode Blocks.

If you mine Diamond Ore with an Iron, Gold or Diamond Pickaxe, a Diamond will drop. Mine it with a Moonstone Pickaxe to get the Ore as a Block. Mining it with anything else will not drop anything. You can also blow it up with an explosion.

Diamondscan be used to makeArmoursuch as Helmets, Chestplates, Leggings, Gauntlets, and Boots.Diamondscan also be used to makeEquipmentsuch as Swords, Spades, Axes, Hoes, and Pickaxes. They are also used in crafting Diamond Blocks and Protectors.
Diamonds can be salvaged for 4 Aura XP Fragments.
Diamonds will naturally spawn between -85 and -99 on the y-axis. Stone in this interval has a 0.28% chance of being replaced with Diamond Ore, then another attempt will be made within 2 Blocks of the spawned Diamond. There are at least 13 Blocks between the two Diamond deposits. They can only be mined with an Iron Pickaxe or better.
Diamonds are sometimes called "Dias, Dims, Diams" or etc.
Sometimes, Diamonds can be found near Gold. This makes an effective mining technique, especially if you have Moonstone Explosives.
Diamond Ore generation heights were changed from y=-86 to y=-99 to y=-85 to y=-99. SeeOresfor more information.

Dodge Bow was a non-limited time gamemode made by one of the developers of the game on April 28, 2025 where the runners run from the seekers and the seekers try to shoot the runners with a bow. The gamemode was shortly removed 2 days after its release.
Dodge BowInfoDescriptionRunners use speed and cover to survive until the timer ends. Hunters use bows,  trying to eliminate all runners before time runs out.DeveloperUnknownScript NamedodgeBow

The gamemode is self-explanatory. In Dodge Bow, only one map is included (which looks like a aquatic museum themed building). Runners have 1 HP (similar to one in the chamber in Minigames) and gets instantly killed upon being damaged. Runners cannot attack their teammates or the seekers. On the other side, Seekers cannot take damage from hiders and the seekers shoot the runners with the bow. Runners have a 5-10 second headstart on hiding while the seekers have to try to shoot the arrows they have with their bow and kill players. When the seekers are released, they can kill the players. The runners and seekers have 4 minutes to hide or seek. There are pillars to help you hide from the seekers. After 1 minute, the pillars disappear 1 layer at a time until they are gone. If the seekers kill all of the runners before time is up, they will win but if the hiders manage to not get caught before the time is up, then the hiders win. On the bottom left corner of the screen, an effect visual is shown for 3 events:
Dodge Bow is the first gamemode to include in-game events effects to the game.
The gamemode itself is very similar to Murder Mystery with the same goal of the game.

The Draugr Knight's behavior is hostile. They will attack you once they see you or you are near them. They run with high speeds at you and and jump up to 4 blocks to reach you. They will chase you until either one of you is dead or you are far enough not to trigger the Knight.
The Draugr Knight has a small chance of dropping a Knight Sword when it dies. This can be used to get a previously illegal item inPeaceful.
The old Draugr Knight

The Draugr Knight used to have a 100% chance of dropping a DiamondFragmentwhen it dies. Now it’s the Knight Heart. This can be used to craft the Knight Sword.
Jambloxds version
They spawn in the Frozen Badlands biome, only spawns 1-2 each. They also spawn inside the huge mountains in the biome, or the Skull Temple, where thespawnercan be found. They also spawn in caves.
It is a good idea to bring a bow to fight them and lots of arrows.
Bring a lot of food likeBread,Apples, and Bowls of Rice orpotionsif you have them.
It is not recommended to melee attack them as they are very tough. Use abowinstead to attack them from far away so that they can't attack you, as they only have a short ranged weapon. Also, don't forgetpebbles, they are very useful for fighting Knights.
You can also dig a 2x1 hole across a cave wall or through a stone spike in theFrozen Badlands. They won't be able to get through, because they are 3 blocks tall and don't fit. Then you can just place a spike at where its position or kill it manually.
Draugr Knights can jump higher than any othermob, making them very, if not extremely, dangerous.
When shot, Draugr Knights are sent flying up to around 7 blocks. This applies to othermobstoo.
Draugr Knights can hit through one block walls.
As of now, the Draugr Knight is the strongest mob, even stronger thanCave Golemand theFrost Golem.
The Draugr Knight was nerfed on 7th May, where it's reach was decreased.
The Draugr Knight now gives strong knockback whenever it hits you.
A farm using a Draugr Knight is more profitable, since there is a 100% chance ofKnight hearts.
If you want to get the Draugr Knightspawner, don't waste time! It takes time for it to spawn, so it is easier to quickly grab it.

Draugr SkeletonInformationHealth150BehaviorHostileSpawns inCave Biome, Mysterious RuinsDamage (no armor)15

The Draugr Skeleton has a chunk of Zombie head as well as a Skeleton head, with a white-colored body as well as some green-colored pixels (This might be zombie skin) surrounding the body, while having a sort of Wooden Armor with a belt and holding a Stone Bow.
A Draugr Skeleton has 150 HP, and it would take 38 punches to kill it or 4 hits using a Diamond Sword.
Draugr Skeletons can be found in caves, preferably caves that are over Y-60 or more.
Mysterious ruins also containMob Spawnersthat can spawn Skeletons that can either be hidden (Under the ruin) or visible.
Frost Skeletonsare a variant of the Draugr Skeleton
Draugr Skeletons are hostile, which means they will attack you no matter what you do, and surprisingly has good aim and a decent speed.
Aura XP when killed: 0.3
Walking Speed: 3.15
Running Speed: 3.64
Hostility Radius: 16
Stopping Radius: 8
Attack Interval: 2000 ms (or 2 seconds)
Draugr Skeletons use the bow, which means that they can hit you from far away. Paired with their unusually good aim, they can hit you almost most of the time. So, it is recommended to hit and run to avoid getting hit by the arrows.
Draugr Skeletons can shoot in a wide range, so it is recommended to keep a close distance to them as they cannot attack you with any melee weapon.
If you really want to fight bow to bow, use a crossbow instead as u can peep out and shoot, then quickly hide to avoid to skeleton's arrows.
The word "Draugr" from "Draugr Skeleton" comes from Norwegian mythology, which defines the word as undead.
The idea of the Draugr Skeleton was that it is a half-zombie, half-skeleton.
Draugr Skeletons have the ability to shoot from around 40 blocks away.
The eyes of the Draugr Skeletons make it look like they are crying, similar to theDraugr Zombie.
Draugr Skeletons usually spawn in groups of two to three.
It was inspired by the Skeleton in Minecraft.
The aim of the Draugr skeleton is so good that it can even hit you when gliding, and it can also shoot you through blocks.
Even when you are in creative mode, they will still aim at you and shoot arrows if you are close to them.
There was a funny bug when a Draugr Skeleton managed to shoot itself.
a bug idk how to do exactly but if you stand in the corner in a 3x3x3 room with 2 skeletons they will not hit you for some reason making a quick arrow farm

The Zombie has four variations with green-colored hair, two arms stretching like anInfectionzombie, with crying eyes.
Draugr Zombies can mainly just be found in caves, preferably caves that are over Y-50 or more.
Draugr Zombies are one of the two mobs that have variants. The other mob is the Cow, which has two variants. Draugr Zombies have over four variants, making them the only mob to have said number of variants, andFrost Zombies. Two of the variants look like a zombie Bob.
Draugr Zombies are hostile, which means they will attack you no matter what. They also have a surprisingly large hitbox and decent speed.

Walking Speed: 3.15
Running Speed: 3.64
Hostility Radius: 16
Stopping Radius: 0.5
Attack Interval: 1000 ms
Since Draugr Zombies have a decent speed, it is recommended to use the Hit & Run strategy. Which makes it easier killing Draugr Zombies.
Draugr Zombies can deal a lot of damage, so it is recommended to always keep a distance from them.
Draugr Zombies can spawn in underground areas other than natural, rugged caves, so remember you aren't safe while in a basement structure. However, this can be greatly improved by fixing the interiors with concrete or unnatural blocks.
The word "Draugr" from "Draugr Zombie" comes from Norse mythology, which are undead Vikings with immense strength.
The idea of zombies were originally cancelled and Cave Golems were brought into the game, but they were added nevertheless, though not as the playerbase expected (it was theorized that they were getting the infection zombie skin).
Draugr Zombies have the ability to hit the player through walls like Cave Golems.
The eyes of the draugr zombies make it look like they are crying.
Drauger Zombies tend to go in groups of 6-9 when spawning.
The Draugr Zombie was inspired by the Zombie in Minecraft.
Draugr Zombies have relatively bad pathfinding AI and are easy to dodge.

6Trivia
Enchantments can be obtained by using anEnchantment Table. EachEnchantment Tableof more and more expensive material will give you better and better enchantment tier probabilities, but will cost more. For every table, there are 3 tiers, which will also give better probabilities for higher xp cost. When enchanting an item, the item will receive on of 5 levels of rarity. This rarity level will determine the number of enchantments the item my have. If you get a level 5 enchanted item, you will get 5 enchantments on your item. Higher levels count as multiple enchantments, so a level 5 sword could have Damage III and Attack Speed II, and that would count as its 5 enchantments.
You can gain xp levels by killing mobs or players, mining, farming or smelting.
The quickest way to gain xp in creative for testing enchantments is by smelting 3 stacks of iron or gold ore or spamming splash xp II potions.
The maximumxp levelis 300. When you die, you lose half of your experience. When you are down to your last xp point, you can never get rid of it.

By switching an item in and out of an Enchanting Table you reroll the enchants. This can be useful as getting more items to enchant can be hard. Like with normal enchanting, the higher the amount of levels you pay is, you will better odds you have of getting a higher tier enchantment. Rerolling enchantments gets rid of those already on the item.

For a while, it used to be possible to turn Dirt Blocks into Tilled Soil by right-clicking on them twice with Shears. Sometimes the Dirt Block wouldn't change its aspect to Tilled Soil, but still looked like Dirt, even though it was acting like Tilled Soil. This way it was possible to create a Flower farm where the ground was Dirt. Shears no longer have the ability to till soil, so such farms are now impossible.

Evil TowerInfoDescriptionClimb your way to the top of a randomly generated tower with absolutely no checkpointsDeveloperArthurScript Nameeviltower

Evil Toweris aparkourgamemode with a randomly generated tower of up to ten floors, which are made of colouredWool.The tower has no checkpoints unless you use a certainboost. You can buyboostsand upgrades by getting up to different floors and completing tasks, but be careful; there are Blocks that are dangerous.Red Baked Claywill cause you to teleport back to the start (unless you have an invincibility upgrade), andMessy Stonewill break when you stand on it for more than three seconds. There is sometimes a floor generated with moving Blocks, making the Parkour harder. However, most of the Parkour is easier due to the vast number of jumps you can skip. The top floor always has two sections-one is like a usual floor made of Wool, while the other is made of Emerald Blocks and looks like a trophy. The finish line is aGoldBlock situated on top of the trophy.

7Trivia
There are many different autogenerated floors that can spawn in Evil Tower. Most of them are just normalParkourwith the addition of some Red Baked Clay Blocks. If you step on those you get teleported back down to the start. However there are some special floors:
The Messy Stone floor. This floor is the exact copy of one of the easier floors except that most of the Wool is replaced by Messy Stone which disappears a few seconds after you step on it. This floor isn't very hard-you just need to cross the Messy Stone sections quickly.
The moving Blocks floor. Another floor has Blocks appearing and disappearing in the air. You need to jump from one to the other in the right moment. This floor is hard if there are many players on it at once as they will represent obstacles. Press F to make the job much easier. Another problem with this floor is if the floor above it has a big floor. This means you'll have to do aHead-hitter jumpbut you might not have time to crouch at the edge of the Block because it disappears too quickly.
The Labyrinth floors. Some of the floors are labyrinths. There are none or almost none holes you can fall through, so the only way not to proceed is stepping on Red Baked Clay or not finding the way out.
There is a limited amount of different floors, however, there are numerous combinations of what order these floors will spawn in. Some of the harder floors never spawn at the bottom of the tower and easier floors don't spawn at the top.
It can happen that 2 certain floors spawn and the floor above blocks the exit from the floor under it. This means getting from one floor to the other is very hard (Head Hitter Neo or Staircase)or completely impossible. In some cases it's possible to get past the obstacle using Powerups, but not always.
Messy Stone can randomly spawn in unusual places in other floors.
You can jump on Red Baked Clay and not die just like you can jump on Water in Pirates. You need toBunny Hopfor this. You can only do it once in a row.
If you join a lobby with no players in it, Bots will start joining until there are 5 entities in the Lobby. The Bots are similar to those in Bloxd Hop but have different names. They can't finish the map. If you press F, they will become invisible.
When you join such a Lobby, the floor combination in it will always be the same: there are always the same 5 floors in the same order, only their colour can differ from Lobby to Lobby. The second floor however, will always be made out of Black Wool. Black Wool never appears in any other floor combination.
Powerupsare used inEvil Tower, and they can help the player finish a map. You can buy Upgrades with Stars. You can gain Stars by gainingXP. If you don't like the upgrade you bought, you can always reset to get your Stars back and buy another Upgrade, if you buy an Upgrade, you can keep buying the same Upgrade until you reach the maximum Upgrade. Below is a list of all the Upgrades you can get in EvilTower.
There are 4 commands available in EvilTower. Type them in chat.
/commands- Displays the available commands
/level- Displays your level, experience points and the number of experience points you need to get to the next level.
/rules- Gives information about how to play this mode.
/hide- To execute it you need to press F. When pressing F all players will become invisible, except for theirPlayer Name Tagsand their shadows. This allows you play with more ease as your view isn't blocked by their bodies.

Evil TowerInfoDescriptionClimb your way to the top of a randomly generated tower with absolutely no checkpointsDeveloperArthurScript Nameeviltower

Evil Toweris aparkourgamemode with a randomly generated tower of up to ten floors, which are made of colouredWool.The tower has no checkpoints unless you use a certainboost. You can buyboostsand upgrades by getting up to different floors and completing tasks, but be careful; there are Blocks that are dangerous.Red Baked Claywill cause you to teleport back to the start (unless you have an invincibility upgrade), andMessy Stonewill break when you stand on it for more than three seconds. There is sometimes a floor generated with moving Blocks, making the Parkour harder. However, most of the Parkour is easier due to the vast number of jumps you can skip. The top floor always has two sections-one is like a usual floor made of Wool, while the other is made of Emerald Blocks and looks like a trophy. The finish line is aGoldBlock situated on top of the trophy.

7Trivia
There are many different autogenerated floors that can spawn in Evil Tower. Most of them are just normalParkourwith the addition of some Red Baked Clay Blocks. If you step on those you get teleported back down to the start. However there are some special floors:
The Messy Stone floor. This floor is the exact copy of one of the easier floors except that most of the Wool is replaced by Messy Stone which disappears a few seconds after you step on it. This floor isn't very hard-you just need to cross the Messy Stone sections quickly.
The moving Blocks floor. Another floor has Blocks appearing and disappearing in the air. You need to jump from one to the other in the right moment. This floor is hard if there are many players on it at once as they will represent obstacles. Press F to make the job much easier. Another problem with this floor is if the floor above it has a big floor. This means you'll have to do aHead-hitter jumpbut you might not have time to crouch at the edge of the Block because it disappears too quickly.
The Labyrinth floors. Some of the floors are labyrinths. There are none or almost none holes you can fall through, so the only way not to proceed is stepping on Red Baked Clay or not finding the way out.
There is a limited amount of different floors, however, there are numerous combinations of what order these floors will spawn in. Some of the harder floors never spawn at the bottom of the tower and easier floors don't spawn at the top.
It can happen that 2 certain floors spawn and the floor above blocks the exit from the floor under it. This means getting from one floor to the other is very hard (Head Hitter Neo or Staircase)or completely impossible. In some cases it's possible to get past the obstacle using Powerups, but not always.
Messy Stone can randomly spawn in unusual places in other floors.
You can jump on Red Baked Clay and not die just like you can jump on Water in Pirates. You need toBunny Hopfor this. You can only do it once in a row.
If you join a lobby with no players in it, Bots will start joining until there are 5 entities in the Lobby. The Bots are similar to those in Bloxd Hop but have different names. They can't finish the map. If you press F, they will become invisible.
When you join such a Lobby, the floor combination in it will always be the same: there are always the same 5 floors in the same order, only their colour can differ from Lobby to Lobby. The second floor however, will always be made out of Black Wool. Black Wool never appears in any other floor combination.
Powerupsare used inEvil Tower, and they can help the player finish a map. You can buy Upgrades with Stars. You can gain Stars by gainingXP. If you don't like the upgrade you bought, you can always reset to get your Stars back and buy another Upgrade, if you buy an Upgrade, you can keep buying the same Upgrade until you reach the maximum Upgrade. Below is a list of all the Upgrades you can get in EvilTower.
There are 4 commands available in EvilTower. Type them in chat.
/commands- Displays the available commands
/level- Displays your level, experience points and the number of experience points you need to get to the next level.
/rules- Gives information about how to play this mode.
/hide- To execute it you need to press F. When pressing F all players will become invisible, except for theirPlayer Name Tagsand their shadows. This allows you play with more ease as your view isn't blocked by their bodies.

Bloxd.io is a free online multiplayer game where players can build, explore, and interact in a dynamic 3D world. Released in January 2021, It’s a fun and immersive experience where you can create your own designs, battle other players, or simply hang out with friends in an ever-expanding virtual universe.
Below is a list of game modes:
Bloxd.io is playable on desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile.
To ensure the security of the game files and that gameplay is fair, Bloxd.io does not allow any sort of external client or userscript that manipulates the game. This includes autoclickers. If you see someone who is autoclicking or hacking, please screenshot them and report them on the officialDiscord server.
The developers are...
Arthur
DirtyFleaSack
Oliver
Nick (pixelbaker)
Tom
Slushie
The other developers,Stardue,Mattzap, andWeiqing, no longer work for Bloxd.io.
Bloxd.io is inspired byMinecraftand the games have a lot in common. There is a rumor that Bloxd.io is a scam of Minecraft. However, Bloxd.io has a lot of its own features, it is also a free-to-play browser game and targets a younger age group than Minecraft. Bloxd.io also has elements from other popular games likeRoblox(again, there is a rumor that Roblox is a scam of Lego).
Bloxd.io can be played by people 13 or more years old. Those under this age requirement need permission from a parent or guardian. However, Bloxd.io has a player base of people mostly aged below 16 and good regulation, swear filters etc., making it suitable for children.
Bloxd.io has an educational edition which can be found by visitinghttps://bloxdk12.com/
Bloxd.io is a free-to-play online game that doesn't require the user to pay anything. There are advertisements in the game (this usually happens when you die in PVP or falling into the void or just try to kill your self and test this). You can remove them and unlock additional perks by purchasingSuper Rank.
If you can't join a lobby, first check your internet connection. If it is fine, try reloading the page or closing it and re-opening it. If this still does not work, try going to the testing site,staging Bloxd.io. One of the possible reasons why you can't connect to Bloxd.io is that the developers are currently updating the game. Just wait a bit and try again. If you can't join Bloxd.io for a long time, it is probably a bug in the game. You can report it on the official Bloxd.io Discord server.
Iron Watermelon is an Easter eggBlock. It has a 0.001% chance of growing from a Watermelon Stem. To obtain it, break it with aPickaxe.
It has been confirmed byArthurthat the entity was real but removed. It was still found in the game files for an unknown reason.
Protectorsare Blocks that prevent other players from placing or breaking Blocks and opening Chests in three Chunks. They are available in Open World Game Modes. A Chunk is a 32×32×32 Blocks big area. Coordinates of each Chunk do not change. You can enable Chunk coordinates display in the Options. A Protector always protects the Chunk it is placed in and the Chunks above and below it. If a Chunk is already protected, by you or by other's, you can't place any more Protectors in the Chunk. Protectors you placed will disappear if you do not join the lobby for 30 or more days. Also you cannot Place Protectors and/or Tribe Protectors within a 192-block radius of true spawn (0 , 0 , 0).
Even tough duplicating Items will not get you banned in Bloxd.io, it is not recommended to do it. We do not wish to encourage duping and want to keep the duping methods, if they exist, as little known as possible. You can checkpatched duping methodshere.

A giant bridge that has some parts shattered, but you canparkourthrough them, or even just glide through withHang Gliders. This sits outside of spawn, so PvP is enabled.
At the end of the Grass Bridge, you will find yourself in a floating ship belonging to a trader. The price here are always cheaper than the market, because the trader does not care about players fighting on his ship. So if you want to be here, be careful and maybe bring a few bodyguards...
* Juicy Growables can be any one of the following:
Watermelon
Melon
Pumpkin
Carved Pumpkin
Jack'o Lantern

You can create a Faction with 50 gold coins or, you could join a Faction.Factionowners can claim Protectors if a sufficient power level is reached. AFactionProtectorworks just as aTribe Protectorbut you have to earn them using power fromTribeMembers if you're the owner of aFaction.
Note thatFactions will be disbanded if they have been inactive for 60 days.
Get power for being online orkillingplayers (if they have “advanced items”)! You lose a load of power for being inactive for sometime or upon death.
Power is used for getting more protectors for your faction, so if you want to expand, play more! The maximum Power a player can have is 100. You gain one Power per minute that you are online.
If you had a very little amount of Power and died (Due to Players or Environment (e.g. Lava) ), your Power would plunge down to Negative Numbers and would be displayed as a red color)
Faction Protectorsare items exclusively used with Factions. You can buyFaction Protectorsusing 100 coins in the utilities tab. They work exactly the same asTribe Protectors. The more Power yourFactionhas, the moreFaction Protectorsyou can claim, and vice versa, meaning if your faction loses Power, the amount ofFaction Protectorsyou can claim goes down, which can result in yourFactionbeing vulnerable to raiding if you placed more than the maximum amount ofProtectors. One good way of making a faction lose power is to kill their members.
You can press F in somebody else’s chunk to raid it if the Faction it belongs to is vulnerable to raiding.
This feature was added on 16 May. The default rank of a member is Recruit.
Added on 7 June, this feature allow senior faction members to change the appearance of the faction in the faction list tab. The icon can be changed into these icons.



On 7 July, 2024, a neutral faction named as "Beginner's Brigade" was added toFactions. Players will join it (as a recruit) when they play in the lobby that they are currently in for the first time. This faction have eight homes labeled as "North Camp," "North-East Camp," "East Camp," "South Camp," "South-West Camp," "West Camp," "Wood Mill," and "Sand Mine." The last two homes are also set as warps, where players can buy or sell Sand, Red Sand, Logs, and Leaves. The "North-East Camp" and "South-West Camp" have PVP toggled as on. All of the areas are set at about 11,000 blocks away from spawn, and reset every couple of hours or when all players leave the lobby.

The old market had different items that you could buy and sell with different prices, listed below:


The builds in the Factions thumbnail are screenshots from the following lobbies: build_legacy, kittygirl12, bl/oxd and bloxd.champions.
ThisGame Modehad the 2nd-place record for shortest existence as it only existed for 4 hours. (Prisonexisted for less than 30 minutes when it was first added)
When it was first released, thegame modewas inpeaceful, and the floating airship and village didn't exist.
An old bug is that the market disappears, which was fixed, made a large impact on theGame Mode. Many players joining thought that there were no Market as the older players described, making them think that Factions is boring.
Factions seems to be a broken gamemode, as some lobbies were not join-able for some time. This is fair as this gamemode needs the most WiFi/Data from Tribe Protection (has to refresh rapidly to ensure only factions members has access - some players may keep kicking people and recruiting them), or other mechanics.
Faction shares the same seed (and identicalterrain generation) with theSurvival,Peaceful,Creative, andAnarchylobbies that have the same lobby code.
The Factions build height limit is 1000.
When you join the Beginner's Brigade you are a recruit but you can break your own faction territory blocks which you normally can't do in other Factions.
There is also a glitch that has been discovered by players where certain players are able to venture outside the world border without being teleported back.
There is a glitch where you can break the Beginner’s Brigade’s blocks with a normal Factions

4Different MLG's
5Trivia
Fall Damage was added toBloxdonFebruary 20th, 2025. It was later introduced toBedWarsgamemode as well (as ofFebruary 24, 2025) and can also be enabled inWorldslobbies using the command:/togglefalldamage.
The amount of fall damage aplayertakes depends on the height they fall from:
Falling0 to 10 blockscausesno damage.
Falling fromover 60 blockscauses the player to lose100 health, resulting in death (unless they have more than 100 health, such as inLifestealWorlds (also if they have Creative Mode)).
Falling between10 and 60 blocksdeals damage based on the height. These values can be found using the chart and table below.
An Approximation formula for fall damage is below, Negative damage is set to 0
Damage = 2.003*Height - 20.42
Fall Damage Graph
The addition of fall damage introduces a new strategic element toBloxd. Now players can complete different types of MLG to not take fall damage. A list of MLG's in Bloxd are listed here:
WaterBucket
LavaBucket
Net (side of block)
Cobweb(side of block)
AllLaddersand Vines (side of block)
OpenedTrapdoors(side of block)
Floor Creators (if timed correctly)
Bed(set spawn point while falling and respawn on top)
Boat(if you place it and get in, pretty useless since you need water anyway)
Hang Glider
Moonstone Orb
Snowdash
Updraft
Fireballs (shoot fireball before and jump onto it)
Press to TP boards
Bed(set spawn)
Remote Explosive (explode at perfect time)
Code block+ max health code
Block (place block before you touch floor)
Ask owner forcreative
Spikes(technically this is possible because the split second damage ignoring thing of Instant Damage Arrows)
Using defense potion/Corn.
There are probably more but I didn't have time to test lots of blocks.
You can receive fall damage when landing with ahang gliderif you hit the ground too hard. The way to avoid this is when landing to pull up so that you are gliding just above the ground as you land. Also you can pull up to lose some of your speed before you land.

When a Flower or Mushroom is placed on Tilled Soil with Tilled soil surrounding it, it spreads.
It is advisable to place it in the center of a Tilled Soil Patch since it would spread in 8 directions .
Hoescan be used for efficient harvest.
When a Fat Cactus or a normal Cactus is placed on normal Sand, it grows up to three Blocks high, and it grows to four Blocks high when you plant it on Red Sand. Use aBucketon a Fat Cactus to get a Water Bucket. The Cactus will turn dry, but will return to normal after a bit of time when placed. AGlass Bottlecan also be used to collect Water, without the Cactus drying, though.
Vines will slowly grow and creep up walls, so any wall can be used for farming Vines.
Hoes orShearscan be used for efficient harvest.
Trees need a large space to grow successfully.
Saplings obtained from the trees leaves can be placed down to grow a Tree.
Hoes can be used for efficient harvest of leaves and anAxefor Logs. You can also use aMoonstone Axeto chop Trees faster.
When you break grass without using shears, there's a chance that a wheat seed will drop. Plant the seeds on tilled soil, and they will slowly grow. When you harvest the fully grown wheat, it will drop 1-2 wheat and some seeds.
Hoes can be used to harvest more efficiently.
Cranberry bushes grow Cranberry naturally, and right click a fully grown Cranberry bush to harvest the Cranberry. Eating Cranberry gives you the Haste effect.
Juicy Growablesinclude Melons, Watermelons, and Pumpkins.
When harvesting Melons and Watermelons with any tool, they drop four Slices of Melon and Watermelon Slices respectively. You can craft four Slices into a Seed or a Melon/Watermelon. When growing Watermelon, there is a 0.01% chance it will grow anIron Watermelonthat has to be mined with aPickaxethat is Stone tier or above. You can craft it into 128Iron Bars, but you can't craft an Iron Watermelon. When you harvest a Pumpkin, it will drop itself, but you can craft it into a Seed via aWorkbench. You can makePumpkin Pieand Jack-o-Lanterns with Pumpkins.
You gain increased Damage when you eat a Pumpkin Pie, Invisibility with Melon Slice, and Jump Boost with Watermelon Slice.
Use an Axe to improve efficiency on the three normal Juicy Growables, and use a Pickaxe to mine Iron Watermelon. A Moonstone Axe will make Watermelons and Melons drop themselves and not slices.
Place a Cotton Seed on a Block and it will grow. Harvest Cotton by right-clicking it.
Place aCornseed on Tilled Soil, and it will grow up to three Blocks high. The top two Blocks will yield corn if you right-click them when they have yellow pixels. A Seed will drop from breaking any part of a Corn plant.
Eating Corn will grant you a shield of 20 extra Health points.
Place a Chili Pepper seed on Tilled Soil or Sand, and it will grow up. Right-click to harvest Chili Peppers when it is mature. You gain the Heat Resistance effect when you eat it. A Seed will drop if you break it. Chili Pepper grows faster on Red Sand than normal Sand. If you plant a Chili Pepper Plant so that it's touching Lava on any side, including above, the Chili Pepper Plant will grow in a red color and drop two Chili Peppers instead of just one.

To not make the tables scuffed and odd, here are introductions to theGunsinstead.
↑1.01.11.2Tanky Gun that deals decent damage per shot.
↑2.02.12.2Quick shooting Gun that is capable to kill multiple people at once. Has one of the quickest fire rates in all Guns.
↑3.03.13.2Great Semi-Auto Sniper that deals decent damage. Is genuinely outclassed by MP40 or Double Barrel on close ranges, although performs excellently on Mid-Range fights.
↑4.04.14.2Accurate Sniper Rifle that can deal 100 damage with two headshots. Better than AWP when tower-sniping, but the low fire rate makes it worse in close range fights.
↑5.05.15.2A Gun that reloads fast, moves quickly when on hand, and shoots quick with a high-Clicks Per Second if on PC, and an overall acceptable shooting speed on mobile. The decent accuracy and overall great stats makes it the balanced fighter.
↑6.06.16.2A deadly Sniper Rifle (if used right), capable to take away 105 hp with 1 head shot, so beware! The weakness of this Gun is that the scope image is blurred while walking and for around a second while toggled. The accuracy without a scope is unacceptable as it is a one-and-done Gun with a slow fire rate, unlike MP40.
↑7.07.17.2The best close range Gun without a doubt. The first gun that can 1-shot 100 hp, second being the AWP, but shoots way quicker and has an overall higher fire rate than that.
↑The Detective's Gun that has a better accuracy, and CAN be re-used.
↑A Gun that can be obtained when 10Moonstoneis obtained, or has a chance to be found in the dino's atlar in the Dinosaur map. Can only be shot once then vanishes.
All Guns have been obtained in survival. (Except for RPGs and Grenade Launchers)
Guns have been used in four different gamemodes.
Some secret models of Guns are hidden in the game files.
Guns are the only Items that can't break Blocks while on hand.
Sometimes if you reload Guns your character will do a 360 degree turn with their hands, which is unknown if it is a bug or Easter egg.
Guns used to have realistic models before they then updated it.
The Minigun is considered the most OP Gun in the game with a total of 100 bullets and high damage. However, the Gun holder will be affected by the Slowness effect (not shown on the screen) and the person damaged by the Gun will also be affected by this effect.
The RPGs and Grenade Launcher are the only Items that do the same thing (shoot) when you right-click or left-click.
If you previously had a gun in greenville, it will be removed from your inventory upon joining, like how you cannot pickup explosives.

Fireballs can launch you 21.4 blocks high if thrown directly downwards.
InBedwars(All modes (Solos, Dous, Trios and Squads) andPirates, using a Fireball to shoot enemies will not only give them damage, but also send them flying up or thrown into the void.
Fireballs can be used to climb high pillars, which can be very useful. But be careful, they do damage.
Fireballs are useful inBedwars,Piratesand other gamemodes. InBedwars, they can be obtained by buying from your base shop using 60Coal.

Flower’s can be used to dye things. This will turn the Item into a different colour used for decoration. Some flower’s  must be used together to make a colour. Poppy is also used to make Slowness Potion.
These are Blocks that can be dyed:
Planks
Baked Clay
Wool
Concrete
Glass
Beds
WoodArmor
To colour an Item, use Flowers. Below is a list of Flowers that can dye things. All recipes are used in theArtisan Bench. Please note that Cactus can replace Grass/Tall Grass and Red Tulip can replace poppy  in any of the recipes.
Once you have obtained 1 of any type of Flower, you can farm it to get an infinite amount of Flowers of the same type. Place a Flower on a patch ofTilled Soiland wait. After some time, new Flowers will grow on the other Tilled Soil. The speed at which new Flowers grow depends on how many Flowers you initially planted and where you placed them. The more Flowers there are around an empty Tilled Soil Block, the fastest a new Flower will grow on the empty Block. The fastest way to farm Flowers is by placing them in the shape of a chessboard, so each empty square has four full squares around it.
These are Flowers that can't be obtained in OpenWorlds. Players got them usingglitches or hacks.
This Flowers areDeveloper Items.
This Flower can not be found growing in usual Worlds, but it is part of different maps in Gamemodes like Greenville, Murder Mystery etc.

2History
3Food Blocks
4Foods
5Trivia
Food are items that when eaten, regenerate health or give an effect. To eat a food, you usually just have to hold down the right click button.  However, this change has also introduced a notable caveat: Food items can no longer be personalized with aName Tag, thereby limiting the ability to customize and distinguish between individual Food items. It is worth noting that certain Food items, such as Mushroom Soup, Bowl of Rice, and Bowl of Cranberries, among others, remain exempt from this stacking functionality and continue to occupy individual slots, even when multiple units are acquired. This exception highlights the nuanced and varied nature of Food items within the game, with different types exhibiting distinct properties and behaviors.
The introduction of food to the game dates back toSurvivalmode's introduction, withBreadandApplesbeing the first edible items to be added to the game.
On November 3rd, 2023, eating and drinking now requires time, which stops players from Bread Spamming (Bread Spamming is eating Food non-stop duringPvP. This is unfair as it breaks the balance ofPvP.)
Soon after coconuts were added, normal coconuts were changed toProjectilesand they can now be cracked by being tossed on the ground. An uncracked coconut can actually give the speed effect by landing on a player.
Food items have become stackable in a recent update, making it easier to farm food and to carry enough food for a journey. This modification has slightly changed pvp, but is most of Quality of Life update.
Since Food was not stackable, Food Blocks were introduced to allow players to store Food much more easily. Craft them from Food in aWorkbench. However, they are now less commonly used as the development team introduced food stacking. They still allow you to carry more food in a stockpile, but the problem of running out of space for food is almost never a problem with new stacking.
Crafting recipes for Food Blocks can be found in the table below. Note that Coconuts can only be crafted into Coconut Blocks when they are not cracked. You cannot eat a normal coconut.
Rice, Cranberries and Mushroom are stackable but can't be eaten without a Bowl. When in a Bowl, they are not stackable. Eating a Bowl of Cranberries, Bowl of Rice or Mushroom Soup leave the Bowl item. Mushrooms can also be crafted into Mushroom Blocks, and Rice Bowls can be eaten faster than most foods.


The "Bowl of Cranberries" Item has 4 Variants, as every time you scoop some from a Cranberry Bush ("Cranberries" as an item), it only fills 1/4 of the Bowl.
Bowls of Cranberries used to be broken in press to buy boards.
The different stages of Bowls of Cranberries used to have separate names.
Although Bread or other Food spam is patched, some players spamSplash Potionswith the same effects instead. This is less spam-able becauseSplash Potionsdo not stack.
Food boosts are critical inPvP, especially inSky WarsandBed Wars.
Most Foods give you an effect instead of restoring HP. (e.g. Watermelon Slice = Jump Boost)
The Pumpkin Pie has the longest eating time (approximately 3 seconds) and Bowls of Rice and Mushroom Soup tie for the fastest eating Food at approximately 0.45 seconds.
Most Food arePotioningredients of the Potions that give the same effects that they give. For example, Plums give a damage boost, so the Potion that is brewed with it also gives a damage boost.
It is recommended to use a Bowl of Cranberries for haste instead of a Haste Potion as making the Haste Potion requires more materials and a Bowl of Cranberries can be reused by scooping up Cranberries from a Cranberry Bush. The Haste Potion gives 50 seconds of Haste, but a Bowl of Cranberries gives only 48 seconds of haste (two less seconds, but still, it is more convenient to use Bowl of Cranberries instead).

Below is a list of game modes:
Bloxd.io is playable on desktop, laptop, tablet, or mobile.
To ensure the security of the game files and that gameplay is fair, Bloxd.io does not allow any sort of external client or userscript that manipulates the game. This includes autoclickers. If you see someone who is autoclicking or hacking, please screenshot them and report them on the officialDiscord server.
The developers are...

The other developers,Stardue,Mattzap, andWeiqing, no longer work for Bloxd.io.
Bloxd.io is inspired byMinecraftand the games have a lot in common. There is a rumor that Bloxd.io is a scam of Minecraft. However, Bloxd.io has a lot of its own features, it is also a free-to-play browser game and targets a younger age group than Minecraft. Bloxd.io also has elements from other popular games likeRoblox(again, there is a rumor that Roblox is a scam of Lego).
Bloxd.io can be played by people 13 or more years old. Those under this age requirement need permission from a parent or guardian. However, Bloxd.io has a player base of people mostly aged below 16 and good regulation, swear filters etc., making it suitable for children.
Bloxd.io has an educational edition which can be found by visitinghttps://bloxdk12.com/
Bloxd.io is a free-to-play online game that doesn't require the user to pay anything. There are advertisements in the game (this usually happens when you die in PVP or falling into the void or just try to kill your self and test this). You can remove them and unlock additional perks by purchasingSuper Rank.
If you can't join a lobby, first check your internet connection. If it is fine, try reloading the page or closing it and re-opening it. If this still does not work, try going to the testing site,staging Bloxd.io. One of the possible reasons why you can't connect to Bloxd.io is that the developers are currently updating the game. Just wait a bit and try again. If you can't join Bloxd.io for a long time, it is probably a bug in the game. You can report it on the official Bloxd.io Discord server.
Iron Watermelon is an Easter eggBlock. It has a 0.001% chance of growing from a Watermelon Stem. To obtain it, break it with aPickaxe.
It has been confirmed byArthurthat the entity was real but removed. It was still found in the game files for an unknown reason.
Protectorsare Blocks that prevent other players from placing or breaking Blocks and opening Chests in three Chunks. They are available in Open World Game Modes. A Chunk is a 32×32×32 Blocks big area. Coordinates of each Chunk do not change. You can enable Chunk coordinates display in the Options. A Protector always protects the Chunk it is placed in and the Chunks above and below it. If a Chunk is already protected, by you or by other's, you can't place any more Protectors in the Chunk. Protectors you placed will disappear if you do not join the lobby for 30 or more days. Also you cannot Place Protectors and/or Tribe Protectors within a 192-block radius of true spawn (0 , 0 , 0).
Even tough duplicating Items will not get you banned in Bloxd.io, it is not recommended to do it. We do not wish to encourage duping and want to keep the duping methods, if they exist, as little known as possible. You can checkpatched duping methodshere.

--- Page 128: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Friends ---
Friends is a feature inBloxd.iothat can be used to join the same lobby as your friend and know their avatar. This feature was released at around September 18, 2024.
This feature can be used if you want to talk with your friends or play together, although you can either send a friend request in game by pressing their name in chat and pressing "Send friend request" OR, you could just type their username at the friends list. On December 17th, 2024, a strange yellow oval appears next to your friends name.

You can add a friend by send a friend request to anyone these ways:
1. If a player is chatting, click on their chat and click Send Friend Request.
2. If theyAcceptthe friend request, they will be your friend, but if theyDeclinethe friend request, you can't be friends with them.
You can remove a friend with easy way:
If you want to remove a friend, click their game name, and clickRemove Friend, now they are no longer on your friend list.
Your friend limit was previously 25, then it was raised to 50, and now it has been raised to 100. When the number of friends has reached the limit, it will say Friend Limit. This also applies to Friend Requests when the limit is 100. When you have limited your friends and still accept a friend request, the Friend System will reload and the player you just accepted will still appear in the Friend Request section.
Friend icons means depending on which skin they use or have, like for example, when you friend them or they send you a friend request, you can see what skin they use and what is it like.
This can be turned on the settings, on the main menu. This prevents players from seeing you which server are you in, and your friend can’t join you. This can be a perfect spot for making something special (test lobby, video lobby, custom game layout, etc.). This can also prevent the developers from leaking a secret gamemode. There was an incident whereNatural Disaster SurvivalandMinigamesgot leaked, soOliverhad to have this option on.
At some point, when you enter the game, Friend System may freeze and show nothing.

The Frost Golem is similar to theCave Golembut instead of using the Grass Block texture in its shoulders it uses a snow texture. Other than that, it does not have much differences from theCave Golem. It stands at 3 meters (3 blocks) tall like the Cave Golem.
The Frost Golem's behavior is hostile, meaning that they will attack you whatever you do. It will start following you if you are near enough to them or attract their attention by shooting them far away.
Aura XP when killed: 0.5
Walking Speed: 3.5
Running Speed: 4.45
Hostility Radius: 16
Stopping Radius: 0.5
Attack Interval: 1000 ms
The Frost Golem spawns at theFrozenBadlandsalong with other hostille mobs like theFrost Zombie,Frost Skeletonand theDraugr Knight.
Like other hostile mobs, the Frost Golem's attacks can pass through blocks.
When killed, instead of dropping Mossy Messy Stone like theCave Golem, it drops Snowy Messy Stone instead.
The best way to fight them is to pillar up 3 blocks and crit them with any melee weapon, or use a bow.

The Frost Skeleton has a Frost Zombie head as well as a Skeleton head, with a white-colored body as well as some light blue freeze surrounding the body, while having a sort ofWooden Armor, stone epaulettes, a belt larger than Draugr Skeleton’s and holding aStone Bow.
A Frost Skeleton has about 100 HP, and it would take over 25 punches to kill it or just 3 hits by using a Diamond Sword.
The Frost Skeleton can be found in the Frozen Badlands, it appears in groups of 2 or 3.
Some structures of the Frozen Badlands contains Frost Skeletons Spawners.
Frost Skeletons currently has no variants like theDraugr Skeletonsyet.
Frost Skeletons are hostile, which means they will attack you no matter what you do, and surprisingly has good aim and a decent speed.
Frost Skeletons all have a bow, which means that they can hit you from far away, so it is recommended to hit and run to avoid getting hit by arrows, or just make it shoot another Hostile Mob so they can fight, or just stay a safe distance away from them.
Frost Skeletons can shoot in a wide range, so it is recommended to keep a close distance to them as they cannot attack you with any melee weapon.
If you really want to fight bow to bow, use a crossbow instead as u can peep out and shoot, then quickly hide to avoid to skeleton's arrows.
⚠️ WARNING⚠️ Frost Skeletons gives youSlownessduring 3 seconds for each damages they do to you. When you are slowed, the skeleton may have a chance to shoot you again.
Try to make 2 Frost Skeletons shoot each other so they will ignore you can kill each other.
The idea of the Frost Skeleton was that it is a half-frost-zombie, half-skeleton.
Frost Skeletons have the ability to shoot from around 40 blocks away.
The eyes of the Frost Skeletons make it look like they are crying or it’s simply Diamond Fragments, similar to anyDraugr Mob.
It was inspired by theStrayin Minecraft.
The aim of the Frost skeleton is so good that it can even hit you when gliding.
A bug I don’t know how to do exactly but if you stand in the corner in a 3x3x3 room with 2 skeletons they will not hit you for some reason making a quick arrow farm.

(Edit: Prior to the Wildlife update, dragur knights now drop a knight heart when killed instead of a diamond fragment. This makes diamond fragments only obtainable through manual crafting with an artisan bench or found in chest inside skull temples.)
Make sure to haveDiamondgear and heals as this is a dangerous biome where many hostilemobsroam.
Bring a long-range weapon, (e.g.Bow) to pick off hostilemobs, such as theDraugr Knight
Foodstuffs(especially the Plum, Apple and Corn) are vital for increased survival rate.
Bring blocks to pillar up from mobs, especially Draugr Knights.
If you destroy or dig certain blocks you can find hidden loot!
There are spike traps in the Skull temple and in the house too so be careful!
Try to bring a friend with you to co-op and increase chances of survival.
Bring Knockback arrows for fighting off mobs to give you time to build up.
Don’t try to melee fightDraugr Knightsunless you are good at PvP/PvE or have decent enchanted armor; use a bow to pick them off.
The Mysterious Ruins in the Frozen Badlands are very similar to the ones in the otherBiomes, but do not let their looks deceive you. These ruins contains spawned from Frost Zombies and Draugr Knights, instead of the regular Draugr Zombies and Skeletons. There are sometimes also gray carpets scattered around the ruins, but under them hides a pit of deadly Stone Spikes. The best way to clear out the Mysterious Ruins in the Frozen Badlands is to get packed withDiamondGear for killing mobs and a Moonstone Pickaxe to mine these Spawners and Stone Spikes when you fall in a trap. Also get blocks for pillaring up when falling to the Trap.
Spiky mountains are skinny, tall mountains. Two types of Spiky Mountains exist. Both contain Packed Snow, Messy Stone, Stone, Snowy Messy Stone, and Stone Spikes; however, one type contains Carved Messy Stone and Diamond Ore hidden inside.
Two types of these Temples, which are huge structures with traps, loot, and Draugr Knight spawners, exist. One has a house with a hidden Block of Moonstone and a Chest inside the grave in the house. Another has Coal, Diamond, and hidden Moonstone Ore.
Loot chests contain Gold, Iron, Diamond, and Moonstone and their respective tools and building blocks, like Concrete and Glass. Some skulls have hidden Block of Moonstone and Chests. One without Diamond and Moonstone Ores has a hidden Block of Moonstone in the roof and the other has a hidden chest under the carpet.
Stone Spikes are scattered everywhere andDraugr Knightsusually spawn in packs of 3 which are able to knock you back into the stone spikes.
Get Blocks to Pillar up while fighting and Pickaxes to mine the Spawner and the ores hidden in the skull ( the ores usually aren't exposed, so mine around for them. Moonstone is most common inside them ).

Red and Brown Mushrooms
Mushrooms act just like flowers, as they spawn in batches and spread on tilled soil.
They can be crafted along with a bowl on an artisan bench to make mushroom soup or craft with 4 red or brown mushrooms on a workbench to make fat mushrooms or mushroom blocks.
Mushroom Blocks
Mushroom blocks act like regular blocks, they cannot spawn naturally but can be crafted with 4 mushrooms.
They are often placed on mushroom stems (an illegal block) or white baked clay to look like massive mushrooms.
They can also be placed on Concrete to make it look like the clothes of a human and the Mushroom Block the head. (Works with Brown Mushroom Block)
A Fat Red Mushroom
Fat mushroom are bouncy versions of the mushroom blocks and can be craft from 4 mushrooms.
The height you bounce of them depends on how high you fall on them making then very useful when building parkour.
If you bunny-hop on a fat mushroom you bounce significantly higher then normal jumping.
Putting Water onto a Fat Mushroom allows you to jump higher than normal but will reset how high you will jump.
Mushroom Soup
Mushroom Soup can be crafted with 2 red mushrooms, 2 brown mushrooms and a bowl.
It restores 10 HP, but 30 when your health below 30.
Fat Mushrooms act likeSlime Blocksfrom Minecraft
In greenville there is a green mushroom house and a red mushroom house both of with do not include Mushroom block but include mushroom stem.
There is a skywars mushroom map.

AFurnaceis aUtiity blockwhich allows you to smeltitems. The only item you can use as fuel iscoal. It can only be crafted by 8Messy Stonein aWorkbench.
AFurnacecan smelt theitems:CoalOre,IronOre,GoldOre,DiamondOre,MoonstoneOre, 2Wheat,Sand, and other things.
AFurnacewill turn ores into craftingitems.Coal Orecan be smelted into Coal, and Iron Ore can be smelted intoIron Bars. This also happens withGold,DiamondsandMoonstone. 2 Wheat can makeBread, and Sand can makeGlass. 3Sandwill make aGlass Bottle, used for brewingpotions. Below is a list of items you can smelt in a furnace:
*You do not need coal for Dark Red Stone see its craft on its page.
In a furnace, you could get 4glassbottles with 3sandandcoal. But in apotion table, you get one instead, so it is more of a scam.
As for now,coalis the only fuel.
As an interactiveblock, the furnace can also be walls of a trap, though aWorkbenchis used more, as it is cheaper.
BeforeObsidian's recipe was added, you could see all crafts with a furnace by havingcoalin yourinventory, though most of it would be red unless you have all smeltableitems.
Note that with the addition ofObsidianand Dark Red Stone, the furnace can now "craft" two items withoutcoal.
On January 14, 2025, theOne Block Widegame mode was added, in addition, a new way to craft Infinite Coal (4 Logs), which became the only ore that does not run out.
Obsidianis now not obtainable by using a furnace.

This is a list of bugs in Bloxd. Different fromCheats & Glitchespage, these exploits are not caused by the player. Instead, they were created by developer coding problems.
Hang Glidersused to be able to go through 1 Block and give you x-ray vision, however, this was fixed not long after.
Moonstone Explosiveused to spawn in the Spawn location inSurvival. This bug has now been fixed.
You could collect block-breaking Items (egFireball and Iceball,Moonstone Explosive, etc) inDoodle Cubeand destroy people's walls and destroy people's "work" after a major update inDoodle Cube.
Grenade Blockwas a broken update Block inGreenvilleand it is aBlockthrown from theGrenade Launcher in Rocket Spleef. The cause of this bug is due to an oversight with the Yellow Concrete Slab from an  update adding Concrete Slabs into the game.
WorldEdit feature was added on January 13, 2025, some commands like: //pos1, //pos2,... however, there is a bug that makes you use commands in multiple gamemodes causing that gamemode map to crash if used excessively.

An example of how the broken reported UI looks.
There was a bug, where if you try to report someone the only option is Stealing/Scamming/Griefing, no matter what they did.
In the press to Boards update, players have been using some tricks to get rare blocks or creative mode. By adding an unsaved character and copying it to a board, then writing:
and when you save the character will disappear and you can get this mode.
You used to be able to set Moonstone Explosive to stand still for a short time (a few days).
Grenade (bug update block) has the in-game name item:grenade and this block can only be collected withMoonstone Pickaxe.
When the Factions game mode is added, players enter after a few minutes, you can collect blocks in there like gold blocks, grass,... and you will see the illegal flower called Azure Bluet, collect it, put it in the Moonstone chest if you have it.
Previously, when you used Snowdash in Lucky Towers, you could get frozen for no reason.
You used to be able to collect Bedrock in a number of different ways.
You can collect a LOT of illegal items in Worlds, most of which appear in Greenville, Defusal, and Paintball.
In Greenville, there is a house called Arena, when a player creates an account to join the Game after Lava is added and buys this house, under the Sandstone layer there will be 2 lava.

There is a chance that the mouse will not get detected, making breaking blocks andPvPa big problem. (This is caused when your mouse pointer exits the screen, thus rendering you unable to turn your head. This is caused by the player and is therefore a “Glitch”.
Finding short-ish, tall-ish grass inSurvival,Peaceful, andCreativeand placing a bed on it, then breaking the grass creates a half bed glitch.
If you set home above a solid object and cover your home with blocks, you will get x-ray and you can see through rock and spot caves.
Dupe Bookshelf Error: You need to have Bookshelf Empty and 1 book, press E or right click continuously, Bookshelf Empty will drop continuously.
Unable to create vertex buffer.
You sit on a boat and behind you is another player, that player hits you, you will fly up and may freeze in the air.
When you enter the Paintball game mode, and when the game is about to start, you can fall into The Void with no end in sight until the game ends.
You can get the x-ray pack by boat and water buckets,

GoldSpawns BetweenY=-75 and Y=-99Chance of Spawning39.35% (per 100 blocks)
Gold Oreis a rare mineral Block found underground.
Gold Ore drops itself if mined by an Iron Pickaxe or better. If mined by any other Tool, not only will it take a long time to break but it will also drop nothing, essentially wasting your time.
Gold Ore will naturally occur between y = -75 and y = -99, and there is a 0.4% chance that the stone-type Blocks in this interval will be replaced with Gold Ore, and then another attempt will be made to generate Gold Ore within 2 Blocks of the generated Gold Ore. There are at least 10 Blocks between two Gold veins.

Gold Fragments can be obtained by killing aDraugr Zombie(Gives 1 Gold Fragment. Small chance to give a whole Gold Ingot) or aGold Watermelon Stag(Gives 10 Gold Fragments, which makes 1 Gold Ingot and 1 Gold Fragment). 9 Gold Fragments can be used to craft a gold bar.

Blocks of Goldare a compact way to store Gold Ingots or can be used as a decoration for your builds.
In [[Bloxd Hop], aBlock of Goldsignifies a checkpoint, a place you respawn at if you fall off the map.
Sometimes, Diamonds can be found near Gold. So, if you find Gold between y coordinates (The middle number) -86 to -99, you can mine around it to find Diamonds.This makes an effective mining technique, especially if you have Moonstone Explosives.

AnOreis a piece ofStonecontaining minerals. Ores can be mined and smelted to obtain useful resources like (Diamonds,Gold,Iron,MoonstoneandCoal)  While the first Ores you find areCoalandIron. Once you go deeper than -75 on the y-axis, you will find most of the valuable ones (Diamond,Gold, &Moonstone). AnIron Pickaxeand higher tierPickaxescan mine all Ores, while lowerWoodandStone Pickaxesdon't drop all, so make sure to craft one before going down into the mines.

Raw Ore is what drops from break iron or gold ore and can be smelted into the bar version of the Raw Ore with 1 raw iron or gold and 1 coal.
There are currently 2 Ores that cannot be obtained inSurvivaland are only obtainable throughPirates,Doodle Cube, Greenville and custom worlds
Emerald Ore(Doodle Cubeas a building Block option andGreenville)
Lapis Lazuli Ore(Pirates- in a cave on one of the maps (removed) andGreenville)
Around 07/11/2025, the developers slightly changed cave generation. At the same time, Diamond Ore generation was changed to generate starting from y = -85. This was first noticed by a texture pack creator (?) (5:04 PM PDT 7/13/2025). For the caves, untouched chunks would have the veins in caves slightly change, and Diamond Ores could now be found at the same level as Moonstone Ores.
Moonstone ores only generate at y = -85.
Coal can be obtained without having to go mining.

Goldrush is a gamemode that was added to the game Bloxd.io on: 5/27/2025 as a limited time gamemode. The goal of this game is to get the most gold fragments or points before the timer runs out or having the required max amount of fragments or points before the timer runs out. This gamemode is unfortunately removed as of 5/30/2025, but then for some reason added back to staging another time on 6/25/2025, withLast Stand. Gold rush was taken down from both Bloxd.io and staging on 7/3/25.

The gold area
You first spawn in your team with your teammates. The entire map is surrounded by bedrock so no one can really cheat. In the corner of the map, you can find the blue trader, who sells upgrades. In front of the trader is a 6 by 6 patch of your team-colored glass and if you stand on it you can “sell” or convert your mined Gold Fragments into points. In your team area, you can find Iron Ores. Surprisingly, it drops Iron Fragments, which can be used as upgrades. In the center and deep inside the stone, you can find gold ores, which drops Gold Fragments. The Gold Fragments only counts as points for your team. There is also stone everywhere which upon mining gives baked clay that is the color of your team. This gamemode is accumulative, meaning your teammates must gather gold in all to try to win the game. PvP is also on, so be aware of players trying to kill you for gold and buy sword and armor just in case and they can kill you even if you are in your own teams area.
This gamemode hasno healingmeaning you will be at risk of getting killed at one shot, so be careful!! Upon killing a person, it’ll drop a single Gold Fragment even they didn’t have one. If a player has more than 1, then it is a lucky kill as you get a bonus. It’ll also drop Iron Fragments if the player had one.
You can win by obtaining 250 gold fragments before anyone else or getting the most gold fragments within the time limit.
When you win, a message will appear saying ''<Color> wins! Thats you! When you lose, it’ll say “<Color> wins! You lost!”
If someone is chasing you, try to use your blocks to create a blockade to prevent them from catching or killing you. If all fails, try to run around the map until you lose track of the killer. If you really don’t want to get killed, leave the lobby and go to an another server.
Upgrade at the start of the game so that you can have a better chance of winning and have a higher chance of survival later in the game as people might try to kill you to get your gold that you have mined. Full gear (diamond pick, armour and sword) will mostly guarantee winning, especially if your team is fully geared.
When an opponent dies, try to make a barrier around their spawn so they waste time trying to escape the barrier, giving you even more time to mine more gold and get more points possibly.
Using other opponents that is not in your team, hit them with a pickaxe and try to make the killer distracted so you can get away in peace.
At your team corner, trying to deposit your gold, try move around the 6x6 tinted lime glass. This way, it’ll sell your gold faster, and if you stand here, you’ll wasted time and this process is slower.
Buying Baked Clay in this gamemode is useless as mining stone gives you Baked Clay and you most likely not need it anyways.

The Gorilla is a hostile animal added to the Jungle Biome update on 7/3/25. This mob is capable of throwingMangoesat enemies and acts like aGold Watermelon Stagwhen near death.
It looks like a gorilla, with a big belly and orange eyes. It has aMangoequipped in its right hand. There are muscles on the back of its body. Its legs are short, and it is mostly gray in color.
Gorillas throw mangoes at you when they see you. LikeSkeletons, they can provoke fights with other mobs by throwing mangoes at them. The gorilla can also double jump, due to theBanana’sability. When killed, likeGold Watermelon Stags, they explode into mob loot.
A Gorilla in-game
The gorilla’s double jump is one of the rare passive abilities linked to loot.
Despite its size, it is slightly slower than an average mob, might be because of its weight.

If you travel carefully far enough, you can reach a different job (e.g. get from Farming zone to Woodcutting zone) If you die in here, you can respawn back at home while the lobby still shows "Isle of Grove". This can also be used for special glitches.
SpleefInfoDeveloperMattzap

Spleefis a sub-gamemode that can be accessed from the main page or through a portal. With skill, you can use the portal to get into the main parts of greenville!
When the game starts, the Snow under you starts to be breakable. Do not fall, or else you will die and lose.
"Kill" people by making them fall by breaking theBlockthey are standing on. You earn a small amount ofCoinsevery time you "kill" someone.
The arena will start shrinking after some time.
Last person standing wins! You earn a large amount of Coins when you win.
Note: The descriptions are fan-made and unofficial.
The Greenville population is expanding, and more houses have to be built, requiring moreWood. But how do you findWoodto cut? Here's the workplace for you.
Go to the Big Portal next to the Woodcutting zone (the area with Wood in the shape of benches). Then, you will be teleported to Isle of Grove.
After going through the portal, you should see many Trees. Chop the Trees down and sell the Logs for money andXPto level up.
Another way to enter the Woodcutting zone in the Isle of Grove is to jump off into the sea or the forbidden village in the farming area and you will be teleported to the Woodcutting zone.
You could use the wood there to decorate your house.
There is also a small Woodcutting zone in front of the Portal. You can chop down some Trees there. Note that these Trees don't drop Apples and Saplings though and also don't grow from Saplings like other Trees. They just reappear after some time. They're not effected by your Luck.
Not to be confused with Shop (see below)
Help your fellow customers to find the objects they want.How do you help them?Here's your part of the job.
Go to the big, brown building near the mining area.
Go to the first floor of the building. There you will seeFlowers,Wool,Ores, Ceramics, Baked Clay and otherBlocks.
Use your Tools to break the correct Item according to instructions given in white text.
Note: This isn't a really profitable job in early game, but in higher levels it is way more profitable than mining, farming or woodcutting, although your eyes could get tired.
There are too many obstacles blocking the town from expanding, so what do you do? Destroy them to earn money.
TheDemolitionarea is just in front of the woodcutting zone and at the left side of the Market. You will see a large build that is randomized between a stone dragon, a pyramid and a wood tower.
You earn money every 15 points you get. You get points from breaking blocks with yourPickaxeandAxe, harder-to breakBlocksgive more points.
You are equipped with a jetpack that allows you to jump at most 6 times.
When the entire build is destroyed, you gain a lot of rewards, and a new one appears.
Grab your hoe and cut some wheat! It's time to do some farming.
Go through the big portal made of Green Stone next to the farming zone (the area with wheat). You will be teleported to theIsle of Grove.
After going through the portal, you should see a big field of Wheat and Hay Bales. Cut them and sell them for money andXP.
Wheat for 2 XP per wheat
Haybales for 8 XP per haybale
A really good job that doesn't require much effort. There is also a smaller farming area in front of the Portal which works just like the other farming area.
It looks like the mine has collapsedand has been refiledwith treasure!Use your heavy-dutyPickaxeto mine the best and shiniest treasure you can find.
Go to the red tents. There should be a pit ofBlockssurrounded byBedrock. Mine theBlocksfor money andXP. There are different types ofBlocks.Clay gives you extra money andXP, and Golden Decoration gives you even more money andXP.
The more levels you have, the deeper and faster you can mine. Your backpack also gets a lot bigger upon leveling up. Starting size of the backpack at level 1 is 20, at the highest level the size of the backpack reaches 380. When your backpack gets full, you must return out of the mine to empty it and get Coins, otherwise you can't continue mining. You can also use F to multi-jump out of deep holes.
Note that you can jump much more and propel yourself upwards in the mining area. You can also use thecommand/up to teleport out instantly.
A decent job to play with and really profitable if you are in high levels.
You can actually get onto the the tents at Mining, the Spleef and Arena by going to the mine and then keep on pressing space. It will launch you into the air. While that happens, you walk towards Arena. You will be able to get onto the roof of the Arena, Spleef, of the red tents! It will be kind of funny if you do it while people are playing/battling in there. People will be very confused...
It's a dangerous brawl! Defend yourself using your sword and armor.
Go to the big dome of glass (not to be confused with the Spleef arena).
Invite players to fight in chat.
A really fun way to earn Coins, but not profitable as not many people will be at the Arena.
Note that yourItemsdon't drop when you die.
Access Fast Travel in the B menu. Fast Travel will teleport you to the location you choose. Note that you must first reach the job once on foot to unlock Fast Travel to that job. Fast Travel can be used to teleport to:
Town Square (no job there)
Mining
Spleef
Arena
Market
Demolition
Maple Woods
Aspen Forest
Wheat Fields
Hay Bale Valley
Keep in mind that using Fast Travel to Maple Woods, Aspen Forest, Wheat Fields or Hay Bale Valley (the entries in italics) will teleport you to an Isle of Grove lobby. This means you will not be able to chat with people who stayed in the Greenville lobby and your house there will disappear.
At the right side of your screen is a panel that shows your mood and level at different jobs.
Decreases when you do different jobs or just walk around for some time. A higher mood means more earnings at jobs. Increase mood by standing on aBed. The highest mood can get is 100% , and the lowest it can get is 0%. At Mood of 0%, your earnings/luck is decreased by 30%. This rises with the Mood and reaches 18% at 100% Mood.
Earnings level means you get x% more Coins every time you earn them at all other jobs except Farming and Woodcutting.
Luck appears at Farming and Woodcutting and means the chance of getting 2 Items instead of one (for example getting two Wheat when you harvest a growing Wheat) There is another Luck parameter that only appears at Farming and Woodcutting. It increases with the skill level at this job. It's not known what this Luck does though.
In addition there is also a Rest Level which is usually valued at a low number like 1 or 2. We believe its the level of the last bed you used (black: 1, magenta: 11).
Doing a job gives youExperienceon that certain job. When you get enoughXPyou level up. You need moreExperiencefor each level, meaning the first levels will be quickly reached while you'll have to grind for a long time to get to the highest level possible (Level 50). Being at higher levels further increases your earnings and unlocks new Minerals at Mining and new Items at the Market.
You can change certain things about your Houses in the B menu.
Rename House: Rename your House. Each of your Houses can have its own name.
Allow Entry: Decide whether people can enter your House or not. You will always be able to enter.
Allow Edit: Give a certain player the power to break and place Blocks in your House. This is a dangerous action due to griefers.
Host PARTY!: Everyone in the lobby will get a message that you are hosting a party. If they press Y they will be teleported to the entrance of your House. If they don't press anything or press N they will not teleport. You can only host a party every few minutes.
PvP: Enable or disable people being able toPvPin your House. When killed people will keep theirInventories. ThisPvPtoggle feature must be bought with 1000 Coins. After that you can use it as much as you want.
Parkour: Enable or disableParkourin your House. When enabled, Red Wool will kill any player if they step on it and Yellow Wool will serve as checkpoints. Orange Wool is the last checkpoint at the end of theParkour. This feature costs 1000 Coins. Once bought, you can use it as much as you want.
When you join Greenville for the first time, you get 4 Houses for free. When you earn a lot of money, you can buy more Houses. There are a total of 19 different Houses you can have. You can add and remove Blocks in all of your Houses.

First go to the Town Center in the B tab, then go to one of the following mini-centers: Woodcutting and Farming.
First you need 2 account, join a greenville world, allow edit for your account; put strong bed, a halft bed in your house and a half bed in your account 2's house, next change your house and break half bed, next return your first house you changed. There are half bed too! Is working now!
Mine some Haybales, and with the Luck effect from the Beds, you should be able to get more Haybales than there originally were. We are going to abuse this and place Haybales on top of the Grass around the house structure. When you mine the Haybales again, the Luck effect should give you even more Haybales than you placed, so you can repeat this more and more until you have the amount desired.
Note: this works quicker if you use a Moonstone Axe. Do the same thing as at Farming.
When it was still possible to getCoal, players could craftFireballs. In some parts of Greenville and the Isle of Grove, players could useFireballsto destroyBlocks, and if you were lucky and found some IllegalBlocks, you could shoot aFireballto destroy them so you could get the illegal Blocks. These blocks are:
woodcutting house out of the woodcutting zone)
Sometimes between October 10, 2023, and October 15, 2023,Arthurremoved allFireballsfrom all Greenville players. If a player touches aFireballthrough theInventoryor just the hotkeys, they will disappear and be removed from the game forever. It is rumored thatArthurwill also remove the IllegalItemssoon.
Around Halloween 2023, the IllegalItem, Pumpkin_placeholder, was replaced with another half-illegalBlock, which is also called Pumpkin. Players can now farm Pumpkins and get other half-illegalBlocks, such as:
Carved Pumpkin
Jack o'Lantern
Pumpkin Seeds
Iron Watermelon
Pumpkin
On March 29, 2024Cottonwas added to the game and the crafting recipes forBows and Crossbowschanged.(Now you need Cotton to craft them).
Since there is no Cotton in Greenville, Bows and Crossbows are IllegalItems.
These Blocks were obtained using glitches.

(Actual name: Grenade)
(actual name: Rocket)
(actual name: Super Rocket)
(now craftable in workbench)
(note: "placeholder" image represents that it will temporary replace the item image until someone deletes it and replaces with the actual item)
Sometime around the 4th of August 2024 a new glitch appeared. In the glitch you could createPress to get Boardsin GreenvilleWorlds. This meant you could get all items available in the Creative menu. Some of the illegal items included:
Pears and PearSaplings(and everything crafted from Pear Log)
Forget-me-not, Allium and Shadow RoseFlowers(and all types of Blue, Purple and Black dyed Items)
Bedrock
Cotton (and allWools,Bows,Crossbows,Hang Gliders)
Rice
Brown Mushrooms
Cranberries
Tribe Protectors
PurpleBeds
Ice and Ice Bricks
Red Sand and its variants
There are other new Items and especially a lot of new crafting recipes from Cotton and some newPotions.
Note: This was patched a short time after. The glitch doesn't work anymore.
Fireballs, IceballsandMoonstone Explosiveis now unobtainable. Griefers shoot them at the Greenville job buildings and destroy the Isle of Grove.  Note that Fireballs, Iceballs and Explosive will disappear from yourInventory.
There was a way to get Emerald Blocks in Greenville. Here are instructions on how to:
You needMoonstone Explosiveto blow up Emerald Blocks. Fireballs don't work. That is also the reason why Emerald Blocks weren't obtained in the previous glitch.
Create a Greenville Worlds lobby. Make apress to get boardfor Moonstone Explosive. Get as much as you need. (you will need at most 100 Explosive for a big amount of Emerald Blocks)
But for now, Moonstone Explosive cannot be obtained for this way, because the press to get boards are disabled in this world.
Fireballs, Iceballs and Moonstone Explosive will disappear from yourInventoryif you:
open aChestwhile you have them in your Inventory
leave and join any lobby while you have them in your Inventory
Drop your Explosives on the floor. Open a Chest. Pick up the Explosives while you have the Chest open. Put them inside the Chest. Leave and join a public lobby. Don't open the Chest. If you do, the Explosives will disappear. You must break the Chest to get them.
Explosives will disappear from your Inventory if you join a different lobby. You can't place or open Chests in the Isle of Grove so this technique doesn't work here.
Version 1 (if you are alone) :Join a Greenville lobby. Travel to the Isle of Grove. Press I and copy the invite link. Leave the game. Open a new tab and paste the link in. You will join the Greenville part of the lobby.
Version 2 (with the help of a friend) :Join a Greenville lobby. Travel to the Isle of Grove. The friend hosts a party and you accept the invite. You are in the Greenville part of the lobby.
Note: using the /home command doesn't work.
Now get your Explosives and walk to the portal to Farming/Woodcutting Area. Don't use any teleports! Go to the Sponge tower between the Maple and Aspen Forests. The tower is made mostly out ofDioriteon the outside. Climb up the big Tree next to it. You can break Blocks on the tree with an [[Equipment|Axe]]. Then jump or Orb to the top of the tower and blow up a part of the roof. You will find a cluster of Emerald Blocks on top of a lot of Sponges. Be careful when blowing up the Emerald. It is very tough so be patient. Do not blow yourself up with the Explosives. Note there is also a hole in the Sponges, which will teleport you back to the base of the tower if you fall into it.
There are otherIllegal Blocks, obtained in a similar manner, like Block of Lapis Lazuli and Invisible Solid.  The Invisible Solid can be found on all the ship in the Isle of Grove. It's next to the Trapdoors. Lapis can be in a smaller tower next to the big Diorite one. Both Blocks are hard to obtain as you need Moonstone Explosive to blow them. This throws the Blocks around. Finding invisible Blocks on the ground is hard (maybe try using aTexture Packsuch as Simple Better) and the chances of the Explosive blowing the Lapis Block into the forbidden area is big.
You can actually get onto the the tents at Mining, the Spleef and Arena by going to the mine and then keep on pressing space. It will launch you into the air. While that happens, you walk towards Arena. You will be able to get onto the roof of the Arena, Spleef, of the red tents! It will be kind of funny if you do it while people are playing/battling in there. People will be very confused...
Even though Spleef is a different part of Greenville, it has the same description. However, the description has absolutely nothing to do with the main goal, breakingBlocksunder the feet of players to make them fall into theVoid.
The Aspen Forest and Haybale Valley are only accessible by traveling far enough in the Isle of Grove.
In the middle of the Isle of Grove is an ocean that cannot be accessed.
Just like inOne Block, there is only one water source: theFat Cactus. They cost 25Coins.
What’s really funny is that when theDevelopersadded Spleef as a sub-gamemode, this happened: when you join a spleef lobby, it would be named “Greenville Spleef [ lobby number ]”. Seems normal enough, but for Greenville, it’s “Greenville Greenville [ lobby number ]“.
Greenville is one of the most glitched gamemodes, as there have been manyglitchesand dupes in its history.
For a very long time there was no way to get Forget-me-not Flowers and Pear Saplings in Greenville.
The Haybale Valley doesn't look like a valley at all so most people have trouble finding it.
If you do not have 100% energy and stand on anyBedyour Energy Level will return to level 1.
When entering the Arena, the welcome message will glitch and be replaced with "greenvilleGame:arenaWelcomeMessage". This is most likely the JavaScript code name for making the message.
When you kill someone in the Arena, the game might think you killed the player two times and give you morecoins.
Explosives now despawn from your inventory no matter what.
Greenville is currently the only new thumbnail to have no players in it.]
entering a house which has visitor access off will somehow state " you are not allowed to enter 's house"

To not make the tables scuffed and odd, here are introductions to theGunsinstead.
↑1.01.11.2Tanky Gun that deals decent damage per shot.
↑2.02.12.2Quick shooting Gun that is capable to kill multiple people at once. Has one of the quickest fire rates in all Guns.
↑3.03.13.2Great Semi-Auto Sniper that deals decent damage. Is genuinely outclassed by MP40 or Double Barrel on close ranges, although performs excellently on Mid-Range fights.
↑4.04.14.2Accurate Sniper Rifle that can deal 100 damage with two headshots. Better than AWP when tower-sniping, but the low fire rate makes it worse in close range fights.
↑5.05.15.2A Gun that reloads fast, moves quickly when on hand, and shoots quick with a high-Clicks Per Second if on PC, and an overall acceptable shooting speed on mobile. The decent accuracy and overall great stats makes it the balanced fighter.
↑6.06.16.2A deadly Sniper Rifle (if used right), capable to take away 105 hp with 1 head shot, so beware! The weakness of this Gun is that the scope image is blurred while walking and for around a second while toggled. The accuracy without a scope is unacceptable as it is a one-and-done Gun with a slow fire rate, unlike MP40.
↑7.07.17.2The best close range Gun without a doubt. The first gun that can 1-shot 100 hp, second being the AWP, but shoots way quicker and has an overall higher fire rate than that.
↑The Detective's Gun that has a better accuracy, and CAN be re-used.
↑A Gun that can be obtained when 10Moonstoneis obtained, or has a chance to be found in the dino's atlar in the Dinosaur map. Can only be shot once then vanishes.
All Guns have been obtained in survival. (Except for RPGs and Grenade Launchers)
Guns have been used in four different gamemodes.
Some secret models of Guns are hidden in the game files.
Guns are the only Items that can't break Blocks while on hand.
Sometimes if you reload Guns your character will do a 360 degree turn with their hands, which is unknown if it is a bug or Easter egg.
Guns used to have realistic models before they then updated it.
The Minigun is considered the most OP Gun in the game with a total of 100 bullets and high damage. However, the Gun holder will be affected by the Slowness effect (not shown on the screen) and the person damaged by the Gun will also be affected by this effect.
The RPGs and Grenade Launcher are the only Items that do the same thing (shoot) when you right-click or left-click.
If you previously had a gun in greenville, it will be removed from your inventory upon joining, like how you cannot pickup explosives.

Hang Glidersare a form of transportation, allowing you to glide through the air while holding it. If you dip down and swoop back up, you will gain speed. However, you will lose altitude the more you do this, and the longer you glide, so be aware! Any form of launching yourself up can help with propelling the glider. They were created byStardue. The higher tier of the Glider, the faster you will go!
The more you swoop, the slower you get! Try aiming around 20 degrees up then horizontally. The quicker you start, the quicker you glide.
It is not possible to use aBoatand a Hang Glider at the same time without getting ejected.
You travel at the approximate speed of 10 blocks per second (in full speed). If one block is a metre, then you are travelling at a speed of 36 kilometres per hour.
Using Diamond Hang Gliders, you can travel up to 108 km/h.
If you are gliding, you will get an effect called "Gliding". The Wood hang glider is the icon for this effect.( In the corner of your screen.)
Gliding and Boating are the only effects that do not have a duration. Even effects such as Raven’s Weakness inPirateswhich are infinite and has a looping timer.
You will no longer be able to fly until you reach the ground after gettingattacked by another player.
You are unable to glide when you are ladder launching, or receiving knockback fromFireballsor Knockback Potions/Arrows.
It is impossible to move backwards while in the air or crouch underwater when you are holding a Hang Glider.
You can fly through cobwebs and nets without getting stuck.
Hang gliders are not really breakable.
If you die in The Void while gliding, you can change to an item in your inventory, change back to the Hang Glider, and change back to that item. you will respawn looking as if you are still gliding. Currently, thisGlitchhas been fixed.
You are able to clip through walls with hang gliders if you glide at a specific speed and angle. You are also able to obtain the ability to X-ray by clipping into walls clip upwards by gliding into ladders this is because the camera position never changed when taking of. ThisGlitchhas been fixed.
Hang Gliders were added on May 8th 2024 byStardue.
They were first mentioned as “HAND” gliders byStardue, as mentioned in discord: "hand gliders!!"
Hang Gliders were first introduced as the Hand Glider that looked like the Iron Hang Glider and were crafted with 4Cottonand 4Wood Planks, the 4 other types of Gliders did not exist until around 24 hours after its release.

Note: Brackets means that the argument is required, while the parentheses stands for an optional requirement.
This command sets the aloud of time a player gets banned after getting killed, in hours. If enabled, the default value of this feature is 16 hours. If set to zero, the player will instantly spawn after getting killed. If disabled, the player will simply be banned forever.
This command toggles whether the players' health points regenerates automatically after a certain period.
This command toggles whether the owne gets banned as well after getting killed. It is highly recommended to be turned off if either lifesteal is enabled or tempban is disabled.
To enable or disable lifesteal, the owner types "/hardcore lifesteal [health point[1]]" into the chat. A zero will disable lifesteal. A value greater than zero will result in a player losing that many health points to their killer after dying. It is recommended for the value to be set between 5 and 20 for a more enjoyable experience.

Hide and SeekInfoDescriptionHide as a block. Don't get caught!DeveloperArthur

Hide and Seekis agame modewith only two roles; Hiders and Seekers. Hiders are moving Blocks and they hide from the Seekers, who have to kill the Hiders before the timer runs out. There are three maps, which are Office, Town and Western. One game takes place in 5 minutes or less. It is not possible to place or remove Blocks in this game mode at all.

There are four unique maps in Hide and Seek:
In map Office, Hiders can choose to hide as a:Workbench, Bookshelf, Aspen Planks, Maple Trapdoor or a Smooth Andesite.
In map Town, Hiders can choose to hide as Maple Leaves, Bookshelf, Maple Planks, Block of Quartz or a Smooth Andesite.
In map Western, Hiders can choose to hide as Bookshelf, Smooth Andesite, Maple Wood Planks, Block of Coal or a Hay Bale.
There used to be a bug where, if you don't choose, you may be aDirt, Messy Dirt, orGrass Block. You'll now become one of the five Blocks randomly if you don't choose though.
As a Hider, after choosing your Block, you can stay still in any position and wait for 5 seconds to build yourself on the otherBlocks. Hidden Blocks will have theirPlayer Name Tagshidden until hit by the Seeker. You can't hide in a space taken by another hider, nor can you hide on top of them. You cannot use them as actual Blocks, as they will be transparent, and you will go right through them.
In office, it is easy to find and spot if the Hider is out in the open, but the size of the map does give some advantage.  What's really smart is that you can hide on top of doors, where there's a rim. When a Seeker jumps there, you can just hit them off, while comboing them withPlayer Versus Player (PVP)skills could be smart too.
In Town, the Hiders are much harder to find because of the complex map and a lot of Blocks that are similar to the Hider Blocks. There are even ledges that Hiders can get on if a Seeker hits them (with knockback)
All Seekers get these Items:
Seekers start with 15 energy. Each time they hit anything they lose some energy, but it refills after some time. If a Seeker has little energy they can't hit the Hiders so well. On normal humanly possible computers you cant hit the hiders.
When the game starts, there will be 2 players among all players who will be Seekers, they will be in the waiting room, after the Hider's hiding time is over, the Seekers will start searching. If the Seekers do not find anyone for a while, there will be 1 of the Hiders who will become the Seeker. If the Seekers find someone, they will beat the Hider until the health is gone and the Hider will become the Seeker.
The game ends when one of the sides wins. Seekers win if they manage to find and kill all Hiders in 5 minutes. Otherwise Hiders who weren't found win. There are no rewards.
There are two different chat options in Hide and Seek. One is global which means that everyone will be able to read your messages. The other option is team chat which allows only members of your team (Hiders or Seekers) to read your messages. It's not advised to tell other Hiders where you are hiding though - they will find you easily later if they get killed and turn into Seeker.
It is possible to escape out of the maps in various complicated ways. There is also a glitch that some players know to glitch through the floor (Office Map). So far, they are unwilling to share these secrets. Using these cheats in though, is unfair and not recommended.
Bookshelf Hiders are glitched too. Before hiding, all Bookshelves are turned upside down. When the hide they change into normal Bookshelves. If they un-hide back, they drop a Bookshelf. However, these Bookshelves can't be used because it's not possible to place and break Blocks in Hide and Seek.
Seekers spawn in a Glass cage if they are chosen in a game of Hide and Seek.
The Seekers' symbol is a Diamond Sword shown at their stats.
The Hiders' symbol is a Block of Maple Leaves.
Hiders can hit Seekers, although it deals no damage. It is a way to taunt Seekers if you have great dodging skills.
Hide and Seek defeatedDuelsin a gamemode vote.
So far, Hide and Seek is the only gamemode that has a non-capitalized letter in one of the words in itsgamemodename.
If the only Seeker leaves the game, the game will choose one of the Hiders to be the Seeker. Or in a game with too few Seekers, the game will also choose one of the Hiders to be the Seeker.
The thumbnail changed on 26 June 2024 with the new UI.
The Western map was similar to the map inBedwarsSquads.
Some of the Town map’s buildings were chosen for theNatural Disaster Survivalmap.
One of the Underwater map’s structures is related to the Ocean Monument in Minecraft.

Developer Blocks and ItemsareBlocksandItemsthat do not spawn inOpen-Worlds, and that developers use to create maps,gamemodes, etc.(They are only accessible byDevelopers, except some exclusive Blocks in certain game modes likeOne BlockandDoodle Cube, obtained by glitches or codes). These are very easy to obtain in worlds usingCode Blocks. They cannot be crafted in any gamemodes, but they could have been previously obtained usingFireballs(inGreenville), obtaining these blocks (in gamemodes other than worlds) are only possible by hackingBloxd.io, using other unknown glitches, or by asking players that have the Illegal Items.

Here is a full list of the items in the game:

Moonstone Axe, obtained before it was deleted from the game files in 2022. It was however, added back as a rebranded item two years later.
Red and Brown Mushroom Block, used to be 2 of the illegal blocks in Bloxd.io (Greenville), but in 2024 it is obtained by crafting with Red or Brown Mushrooms.
Wither Rose (Shadow Rose now), Formerly known as Wither Rose, it is a black flower, illegally collected in the Greenville game mode, similar to other flowers it can be propagated. But after the Frozen Badlands update on May 2, 2025, Wither Rose was renamed to Shadow Rose, collected in the Frozen Badlands biome.
Dim Lamp On, or Blocker, is the firstItemto be added to the game, since they are used inBloxd hop, which is the firstgamemode.
SomeFlowers, such asForget-me-notandAllium, are illegal inGreenville: you cannot get them in Flower Packs. Bluebells are obtained by going to the woodcutting station and harvesting them.
IllegalFlowerscan still be produced as you can farmFlowersusing a square of tilled soil filled in.
Some of theItemshave been found by the players with the help ofglitches.
Mushroom Blocks (Red Mushroom and Brown Mushroom) are no longer an Illegal Item as of May 17, 2024. However,Red and Brown Mushroomsremains illegal inGreenvillebecauseMushroom blocksare Illegal there.
Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks were previously Illegal Blocks.
Because CyanCeramichas aMinecraftCreeper face on it,Arthurcould not add this block to the game, as it would be illegal. However, JanuaryBoy, known as JanuaryBloxd in YT, changed the texture of the block and may have notified the devs or posted on Discord, since it was added on July 6, 2024.
Mushroom Stem is not an illegal block in Greenville as you can get Mushroom Stem in theGreen Mushroom houseand theRed Mushroom House.
Moonstone Axe, Artisan Axe, and Artisan Shears were each in the game for a few days but were later removed.
Barkless Logs used to be illegal, but now they were changed so you can right click a log with an axe to get some. Before that was added, getting Barkless Maple Logs and Barkless Aspen Log inGreenvillewas probably done by blowing up the Woodcutting house with aFireball.
There used to be a bug that Maple Barked Log isn't in the creative menu. The only way to obtain before was chopping the barks of the log. (If your a World Owner and your in Creative, switch gamemode to Peaceful and do the way this trivia entry told. Then bring back your creative.)
Invisible Solid can't mined. It always regenerates right before you would mine it. Only way to break it is withMoonstone Explosive, so careful when placing! Probably it is breakable inCreative, just likeBedrock. Probably with new texture packs added in the game, just useSimpleBetterto break it, Then change your texture pack and put it. (don't put in wrong way again!)
The Block of Emerald and the Block of Lapis Lazuli are secretly hidden in towers near Aspen Forest in theGreenville(Isle of Grove) gamemode.
The Water block can be obtained inSky Warsby repeatedly using a filled water bucket.
Gravel and Yellowstone can be collected inOne Blockas you can collect them in different phases.
Cobweb is no longer an illegal item afterMysterious Ruinswas added to the game.
Cobweb, Barkless Logs and Mushroom Blocks are no longer illegal blocks.
With the addition to Press To Codesigns& Code Blocks and some new API's, you can now obtain every single illegal blocks within ownedWorlds.
UnlikeFireball and Iceball, Toxin Ball has no firing limit.
If you want some items with this symbol (|), then use it between the crop stages (ex. Rice|FreshlyGrown). The symbol for this is called the vertical bar.

The game currently has 5 maps. There are only two teams in Infection which are: the Humans, which will try to unlock all Extraction Points and escape while avoiding being infected (or killed), and the Zombies, which try to infect the Humans and try to turn them into Zombies by killing them. On April 5th, 2024, Infection officially became the winner againstWallsin the game mode vote.
The Humans start the game with a basicM1911(unless certain kits are used though) which is a pistol with 16 ammo, and is one of the worstgunsin the game. On the other hand, the Zombies start with aCompasspointing towards the nearest Human. Theskinsof the Humans are normal while theskinsof the zombies have a green complexion. There are Magenta Ceramic Blocks (blocks with arrows on them) placed on the ground that guide the Humans to an extraction point/obstacle, which requires points to unlock though. Points are earned by killing Zombies. Dealing the final shot or hit to a Zombie grants you 100 points while a defeated Zombie of which you have dealt HP to grants you 25 points. Players can also shoot the giganticDiamondsthat spawn on the map to earn extra points, 50 or 100 per diamond. Near the obstacles, there are also gun shops, which are 2Workbenchesnext to each other that have the skin of theGunsspinning on top of them, where you can buy differentGunsusing points. Players can press [F] to spend 100 points on the extraction points, or buy aGunat theGunshop. You must tap the screen when the offer appears to spend the points if you're on mobile. Humans win if they unlock all extraction points and escape.
Zombies win if they kill all Humans before they escape. At the start of the game, two to around four players are selected as Zombies, but if Humans die or rejoin, they will also be Zombies. New players who join after the game has started will also be Zombies. Some people even become Spectators but this is hard to get as you will need to join immediately when the game started!
Bombardiers can now place a Moonstone Explosive instead of dropping one upon death.
Puker's range got increased and the acidic vomit now gives the Poison II effect instead of Poison.
Miniguns were added as a bonus for the last Human standing.
Saying GG after the end of a match now gives you 1Coin!!!
Juggernauts' health decreased from 200 to 150, and the damage boost got changed from 150% to 125%.
Knockback from both Bombs for Bombardier and Bomber are now decreased.
Zombies' speed was greatly nerfed.
Merging kits is still a problem.
The Diamond and Block breaking glitch was fixed.

There are a fewWorkbenchesplaced near some of the extraction points. You can buyGunsthere. Each Workbench offers a specificGun.
(Note: you can only use oneGunat a time, as buying a newGunreplaces theGunyou had before. If you have specialGunkits likeScout, you are not recommended to buyGunsas they will replace your specialGun.)
Extraction Points are big doorways closed up byGold Blocks. You must pay points obtained from killing Zombies or shooting Diamonds to unlock the doors. The further you reach into the map, the more points are required to unlock more doors.
When arriving at an Extraction Point, you will see a number of yellow locks appear at the bottom of your screen. Press [F] to pay 100 points. For each 100 points paid this way, one of the locks will turn gray. When all the locks turn gray, the Extraction Point is opened and you can proceed further into the map.
Note: you can only pay 100 points per [F] click. It is not possible to pay other denominations of points (eg. 25, 50).
Diamondscan be found around each map and respawn around every 60 seconds, when you first either shoot a Diamond or use a Sword to slice the Diamond, they give you free points and adds up its points and the hit time each section you unlock.
Usually, if you are a Sniper in the Hospital map, you can shoot the Diamond in the building, which can give an easy start-up point and unlock the next section.
There is a glitch where the Diamond spawn and you cannot attack it. This can happen if the respawn time of the Diamond is too short.
TheGold Systemis designed for buyingKitsmentioned below.Goldis obtained when the game ends or after a kill, and if you accomplish any Human tasks but became a Zombie, you still get the rewards when the game ends. When you receive a duplicated kit, you will get a respective amount of Gold of the other type. Note that some tasks do not require winning at all. A recent update made so that you have to at least kill 1 Human to get the Zombie win objective.
They are called "BlueGold", no matter if its the Human Gold or the Zombie Gold, which is presumed as a bug.
What's really funny is that if you are one of the last 3 Humans (NOTthe very last) and die, you will get 5 Zombie Gold and 5 Human Gold (which you can earn by killing 1 Human). This is due to you then turning into a Zombie and winning the game as a Zombie. This also happens if you kill the first Zombie and win as a Zombie.
Strangely, getting a duplicate Human kit will say you earned "BlueGold" even though you earned Zombie Coins, which are green.
You can get one random Human kit for 100 Human Coins and a Zombie kit for 100 Zombie Coins.

As humans, you have a 15-second head start and a long range attack. Obstacle 0 should be a piece of cake, but it is smart to stack up more points and wait for teammates to buy an AK-47 to guard others, while the rest chip their points in Obstacle 1 for opening the Extraction Point.  Repeat the process until reaching the top floor. Try your best to hold a spawn kill den until your team unlocks the next extraction point. It is also smart to practice with your guns in CubeWarfare. Learning how to time your reloads could help you use the AK-47 better. However, it is not smart to skip MP40 and M16 as they are great guns. When you get to the roof in Hospital, refrain from following the arrows as it guides you to walk all the way around while it could just be skipped from a set of ladders next to the roof entrance, leading straight to the helicopter. Health is key, so one very important tip is to stick with your fellow Humans. With a crowd of Humans, it is easier to shoot Zombies quicker before they reach you and prevent you from unnecessarily losing health. Zombies only have melee attacks and cannot attack you if they are far away, with the exception of Pukers.
As a Zombie, you have one major advantage: speed. After getting some extra buddies, storm the extraction points, even if it means sacrificing a few zombies: remember, you can respawn, the humans can't, and if they die, they join you and you get new buddies!
Zombies have a 4-tick shield(aka 3s), which can be breached if Humans shoot the shield immediately after you spawn.
Once one zombie reaches the spawn (after extraction points, in Bunker it's further along sometimes), the spawn is set for that specific zombie. Joining during a game will usually place your spawn one point behind the last zombie before you joined.
Humans used to be able to drop theirGuns, meaning that another player who is a Zombie can pick it up, therefore obtaining a gun. Zombies can also drop their compasses.
Bomber Zombies used to have 150 HP and Speed I when it was initially released before it was nerfed as it was too overpowered.
The AK-47 was nerfed because of this gamemode, as it gave humans a great advantage during early game.
The range of zombies was increased after there was a bug that allowed Humans to stand on top of a car in the parking lot of the Hospital, just out of range and infinitely kill zombies.
Humans used to be able to win if all zombies leave the game.
You were used to be able to "break"Blocksas if you were in aprotectedchunk. It is now fixed, so skipping using this method no longer works.
There used to be a bug where you could not throwPotionswhen using Medic and Chemist. It has since been fixed.
The default gun, the M1911 dealt 350 damage to zombies. Since there was no point system immediately after release, Zombies would always win anyway.
When Infection was just released, as there were no coins, all Zombie kits were available for use and there were no Human kits. Some Zombie kits were also not implemented yet (like Puker).
For every health point you dealt to Zombies, you earned 1 point. This was changed to the 25 and 100 point awarding scheme we know today.
If you die in any way, you will become a Zombie. This includes falling off the map.
Infection had to be rebalanced multiple times as the Zombies were too overpowered, causing them to win much more often.
The Zombies' compasses show the humans as 'Blue' due to the compasses being copied fromPirates.
On 3 April, a Beta release was made, which showed Infection winning the game mode vote againstWalls, turning out to be true.
The workbenches at the gun shop can be interacted with although you are unable to craft anything.
TheJuggernauthas a secret trait:Potions. If you were aMedicorChemistin a game, when you selectJuggernautas your kit for the next round, you can get the potions of the previous kits, and they are renewable. This is likely a bug. Same with Veteran and any other kits except Regular, and Scout.
Nowadays if you buy a new gun, the old one disappears: no more swapping between guns!
If your the last human standing, you get a Minigun exclusive to Infection. It has 100 bullets per reload and shoots much faster than the otherGuns.
The Subway map contains many buildings using names ofdevsand items. They include Bloxd Hotel, Oliver’s Pizza, Stardue Clothing, Mattzap Games, Moonstone Mall (not said in letters, but in logo), Arthur Station and DFS Chicken.
When a puker pukes a human, the human will be launched up. You can use this to get into places that cannot be reached by zombies, making the zombies annoyed.
If you say "gg" (not ggs) after finished the game, you will earn 1 gold. It also works onPirates.
If you put many boats in the Farm map, then vote hospital map, there's a chance that the boats will be inside the reception (which was a patched area because the hallway of it was patched up (IT'S A GREAT CHANCE FOR HIDING)).
There was a bug that people in spectator mode can hurt zombies, making like a boost for humans to kill.
On the 2nd slot, you can see the Aura Xp OrbFor whatever reasons, you can get Aura Xp Orb rarely from killing zombies/humans. This is now patched.
On the 2nd slot, you can see the Aura Xp Orb


--- Page 161: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Infection/Map:Airport ---
Airport, added on July 23, 2024, is the fourth map available inInfection. In this map, the humans start off on the Airport Runway, and win if they reached the Airport Terminal.
There was a glitch where Zombies instantly spawn a TNT before the Zombies come out when they leave.
There is a glitch where if a Puker shoots an acid, the humans can land onto one of the trees at the Baggage Area and most Zombies cannot attack the Human(s).
Some Diamonds give 100 points while others give 50 or even 200.
If you get a bomber to break a piece of a block in the spawn, then used Puker to propel the player up, the player will be on the roof of the train and on the other side is the void. You also can go to the other side of the map where it is blocked up by patterned light gray glass.

--- Page 162: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Infection/Map:Bunker ---
Bunker, added on 10 May, is the second map available inInfection. In this map, the humans start off in a "park" located on level -8 of an underground bunker, and wins if they reached the entrance / exit of the bunker, which is eight floors up.

When the devs made the map, they copied another map fromMinecraft.
When the devs made the map, they "accidentally" left two holes at the top of the stairs leading to the prison. This allowed some sneaky human players to jump onto trees from those two holes.[1]
The devs also "accidentally" left another hole in one of the prison cells. This allowed players to jump into the void, and see the inside of the map before dying.[1]
They also "accidentally" (again) left another hole in the staircase for Level -4 leaking to the hidden areas of Level -3 to 0.[1]
The devs again “accidentally” left a hole on level -8 at spawn. The players can use the Puker zombie’s vomit to propel up the glass and into the cage.
After fixing the leaked glass, the devs also didn’t realized that players can use the cedar ladder at the bush to ladder jump onto the trees.[2]
This map had an extra obstacle (the bunker entrance / exit), which costs 1,400 points to open.
For whatever reasons, the devs didn’t add the TAR-21 weapon anywhere else in the map. It might supposed to be in the cafeteria then.
↑1.01.11.2Now patched as if they're blocked.

With those two holes, they patch it with glass

for the void hole, stone

and the leaked parts of the bunker, glass.
↑This is now patched by covering the park with invisible solid, to prevent players from getting on top of the trees.

TheFarm Mapwas added on November 13, making the 5th playable map inInfection. The players start out after the airplane crashed on the farmland after the previous map, Airport. They can win if they made it to the tractor inside the barn. It is the latest map to be ever released in this gamemode.

You can get on top of a car by jumping from the balcony of the hospital, or just use the knockback from the zombies!
The first extraction point when the game was first released was the current second obstacle. It cost 1000 points and the "door" was made out of PineWood Planks. Other extraction points at that time were about four times as expensive as the current ones.
There were many window ledges to land on the outer wall of the building by doing neos, allowing for insane hiding spots. Access it on the balcony of the 3rd point. or the top of the hospital. This is nowpatchedso no hiding!
The parking lot was made smaller and a lot of the hospital areas are sealed off to avoid humans running in the wrong direction.

Subway, added on 14 June, 2024, is the third map available in Infection. In this map, the humans start off in an underground parking lot, and win if they reach the train in the subway station named Arthur Station (a reference to the game's creator).
1 On the middle of the parking lot
1 In the corner

The name of the station (Arthur Station) is a reference to the game's main developer,Arthur.
This map was later added to the game after the gamemode vote withWalls.
There was a bug that if you use bomber and break the block above it, and used puker to propel the player up, there is a chance that it might glitch through the roof and on top of whatever that is.
Another bug in case a person crouching on the cedar ladder, and yeeted on the rooftop. The cedar ladder was later removed.

The Creative Inventory when you are in creative mode.
TheInventoryis the place where you store your Items. It is divided into three parts: Your hotbar, your crafting orCreativemenu, and your Inventory. You can open it by pressing [Tab] or tapping the backpack (on mobile). The hotbar and Inventory are made out of slots, which each store up to 999 stackable Items or 1 unstackable Item.
The hotbar is ten slots long. Store theItemsyou use the most here. When you start to play, there will be numbers on the top of each slot to help you. The icon which in the eleventh slot, slightly separated from the rest of the hotbar shows you how to get to the Inventory, in which case you press tab, or you touch the icon. When an Item is stored in your hotbar, it will appear in your hotbar slot where you put it. If you hold the Item by pressing the key the Item is on, it shows the Item in your hand. Click or right-click to use it. you can also scroll to quickly switch between Items in your hotbar. When you pick up Items, they will first go into your hotbar. When the hotbar is full, the Items you pick up  will start going into your Inventory.
OUTDATED; YOU DON'T NEED LEAVES ANYMORE BUT NEED COTTON INSTEAD. Inventory and Items and the things you can craft.
The Inventory is a 6x6 square where you store all your Items. Press [TAB], or the mini backpack on mobile to access it. Be careful not to fill up your Inventory with junk! Those Items can be stored inChests. There are 36 slots of storage in your inventory. Click on the Item you want to move to the hotbar and move it to the slot of your hotbar. If you pick up an item and your hotbar is full, it will appear in your inventory. If your Inventory is full, you won't pick up the Item. For more on Inventory navigation, clickhere.
Craft simple Items like WoodEquipmentandWoodPlanks here. This is useful for starting your game, but you will have to use aWorkbenchto upgrade to better crafts and Items. Click on the Item you want to craft to craft it. If the background behind the Item you want to craft is red, it is because you do not have the materials you need to craft it. Even if you have all the materials, the background will appear gray, meaning that your Inventory and hotbar are both full, so you do not have enough space for the craft. Leave space in your Inventory for the craft, and make sure you have everything you need. If you press shift while crafting, you will use all the Items you can use to craft it and create the maximum amount of the Item possible. Be sure to be careful when doing this, as you might waste lots of resources. This display shows at the right of your main Inventory.
1 Cotton
2 Stick
1 Cotton
2 Stick
2 Iron Bar
If you are inCreative, the Creative menu will show instead of the crafting display. If you still want to craft, you can grab aWorkbenchfrom the menu. You can grab infinite of the Block or Item you want from theCreativemenu. If you press [shift] or middle click, you can transport it immediately to your hotbar or Inventory if the slot clicked is empty and it will be stacked to 999 if it is stackable. You can also search for the Item you want with the search bar at the top. Stackable Items are infinite, OnlyProtectorsare limited in the Creative menu unless you are the owner of aWorld.
The fact that Bows and Crossbows can be crafted directly without aWorkbenchis interesting, as you need aWorkbenchandFurnaceto get almost all of the ingredients (You need Stick, Iron Bar, and Cotton to craft it. Stick and Iron Bar require a workbench).

Ironis a type of Ore likeGoldorDiamondthat is used in the mid-game ofBloxd.io. It is farmable, unlike other ores, and is useful before you get Gold gear. Technically, whileIron Oreitself is not farmable (excludes spawn mining),Iron Barsare.
1Overview
2Obtaining
3Appearance
4Usage
Ironis one of the first Ores you will get in the game. This resource can be used to make Tools that can harvest all Ores and make armor that can defend against a decent amount of damage. This Item can be found underground or aroundmountain ranges.
Iron Ore will naturally spawn between -15 and -80 on the y-axis, and there is a 0.5% chance that the Stone in this interval will be replaced with Iron Ore. After this, Iron Ore will try to spawn again within 2 Blocks of the generated Iron Ore. There are at least 5 Blocks between two Iron Ore deposits. Iron Ore has veins of at least 5 Blocks and a maximum of 18 Blocks.
You can also obtain Iron bars by using 9 Iron fragments , obtained by killingZombies.
You can also get Iron Bars on the teams' island inBedwars. It generates 2 Iron Bars per 10 seconds and can help you buy advanced Weapons, a decent set of Armor, and other Blocks.
Technically, Iron is farmable through Iron Watermelons, which give you 128 Iron Bars, though this is a rather unethical way of farming Iron since Iron Watermelons are very rare.
TheIron Bar'stexture is a white rectangular bar.
The texture of the Ore is similar to that of Stone but with a few chunks of beigeIronin it.
The texture of the Block is similar to a Coal Block, as it is not shiny, but the Iron Block is white while the Coal Block is black.

Ironcan be used to makeArmour.IronBars are mainly used to makeEquipmentsuch as Swords, Spades, Axes, Hoes, and Pickaxes. They can also be compressed into [Blocks]. Iron used to be in the crafting recipe of Fireballs and Iceballs, but has later been replaced withMoonstoneinstead.

3Tips for Acquiring
4Trivia
TheIron Watermelonblock looks similar to normal Watermelon, but tinted white.
During the Halloween Update in 2023 (unofficial name),Arthursaid that there would be an Easter egg in the game. The Easter egg turned out to be a block called the Iron Watermelon, which is only obtainable by farming lots ofWatermelons.
An Iron Watermelon attached to a stem
There is approximately 0.01% (1 in 10000) chance of a watermelon stem growing anIron Watermelon. This block can be only mined with aPickaxe; otherwise, it drops nothing. TheIron Watermelonis not craft-able, but can be turned into 128Iron Bars. It can be used as anIronfarm as long as you have an extremely efficient source of Watermelon. The Iron Watermelon is a grand trophy which was created by Arthur.
A good tip to farming Iron Watermelons is to use the Moonstone Axe, which allows you to destroy an entire row using one chop. Make 6 rows of Watermelon Seeds, and then keep grinding until an Iron Watermelon grows.
We still don't know the chance for an Iron Watermelon to grow, the following 2 trivia are based off the most common approximation of 1 in 10k.
You need about 101 watermelon plants to have a 1% chance of getting an iron watermelon, about 1054 for a 10% chance, about 2877 for a 25% chance, about 6932 have a 50% chance, about 29958 for a 95% chance, about 46053 for a 99% chance, about 92104 for a 99.99% chance, and about 112000 for 99.999%. You can never ever have a 100% chance, but you can get very close.
If x is the amount of watermelon plants you have, (1 - 0.9999^x) * 100 (to convert to a percentage) is the percent chance you have to get at least 1. This formula first calculated the chance of NOT getting it at all, then subtracts it from 1 to get the chance of getting at least one.
Even though it's not an illegal block, you still can't collect it in the Creative Menu and "Press to get" Board.

The Iron Watermelon seen by Jokdok
TheIron Watermelonis a white watermelon with black, round eyes and a straight, stern mouth, covered with a red circle.
According toArthur, owner ofBloxd.io, the Bloxd universe was created from the Potato Expansion (basically the Bloxd version of the Big Bang). This confirms that potatoes played an important role in the creation of the Bloxd Universe. The Bloxd Planet's moon exploded 1 billion years ago. Chunks of the Moon flew onto the planet, therefore explaining why there aremoonstoneson the Bloxd Planet and why we can't see the moon. It is speculated thatIron Watermelonhas inflicted magic onmoonstones, which makes you able to teleport by using them (moonstone orbs) and also store items in the same realm at any point in time and anywhere (moonstone chests).
Before the block update in Bloxd.io, the Bloxd Planet did not have infinite terrain generation.ArthuraddedIron Watermelonto jump-scare and tell players "Not to go far." It is said that if players go more than 6,000 blocks away from spawn, they will get disconnected or be jump-scared byIron Watermelon. This haunted the Bloxd.io community, so after the block updates, Arthur removed it from the game.
Jumpscare Loading ScreenBorder Limit Loading Screen
Image 1 shows a loading message in Bloxd.io that reads, "Ever seen a loading screen with a jump scare?" This message refers to theIron Watermelondue to its ability to jump-scare players.

Itemsare objects that can be used by just simply right clicking/ tapping (or just pressing E) while having them in your hand, either as ablockor a projectile. Items can be picked up by running into them. You can also drop items by pressing [Q].(on computer or laptop) To drop all of them you just need to crouch and then drop the items. You can also drag the chunk of items out of your inventory to drop the full amount. Items of the same type will stack together. Many items can stack to a maximum of 999 (e.g.blocks). Some items (e.g. tools) cannot be stacked. Some items can be placed, (e.g.Dirt) and some cannot. (e.g. Tools and Armour)
This is useful when aMoonstone Explosiveexplodes an area. Do note that you have to be touching the dropped items instead of being near it when it comes to moonstone explosives. This is due to the fact that the "item" dropped by the explosives are stacked.
If the item is a projectile, the item must be thrown by right-clicking or pressing [E]. Some projectiles can be picked up after being thrown, such as arrows! And some projectiles cannot be picked up on the ground, like a pebble. These dropped items despawn quickly though! Some other projectiles are for special purposes in differentgame modessuch as the Green Ceramic projectile that can be launched by just pressing [F].
On the official Discord server of the game, Arthur said that items disappear (despawn) after 5 minutes. (this is a message on September 14, 2023, in the #dev-log section)
Afflicts the frozen effect for 2 second on the center and 1 second when you are less than 2 blocks away from it
For example, An Arrow of Strength gives the damage effect to whoever gets hit by it.
Balls/Reinforced Balls/Snowballs can be picked up when they land.
Balls/Reinforced Balls/Snowballs can be used for fireworks or lag machines. (Lag machines that reduce about 10 FPS at maximum before despawning.)
Although Snowballs don’t deal much damage, you can still kill someone with them by throwing a lot into a water block, then throwing an Iceball next to it.
When thrown into water, Moonstone Orbs will slowly sink so you can use a deep-water hole to make a timed teleporter with Moonstone Orbs. However, Moonstone Orbs do vanish after a while or if the chunk is unloaded.
Reinforced Pebbles have increased knockback and have a longer range than normal Pebbles. (Although, this isn't worth it because 9 Pebbles dealing 90 damage isn't equal to Reinforced Pebbles dealing 13 damage)
Iceballs/Fireballs used to be made out ofIron Barsinstead ofMoonstone.
Potion Arrowsthat give debuffs (e.g. Arrow of Slowness) are used to deal even more damage or weaken the target.
The Knockback Arrow used to be able to freeze a player when hit but this was later fixed.
Moonstone Orbs deal 15 damage, no matter how much armor you have.
Splash Knockback Potion can affect items.
Cow, Pig, and Sheep Spawn orbs can spawn Cows, Pigs, and Sheep, but cannot be obtained in Survival apart from Press to code boards.
Tools andEquipmentused to be held differently. Instead of the stick being held, the player would hold it differently, like how a block is held.

Players spawn in a closed building with 4 corridors in all directions, which are closed by lava walls which do not deal damage. The theme of the building is based on theFrozen Badland.
They fight against mobs in order to survive for as long as possible. Players will earn 10 Coal after each wave of enemies, 1 Diamond if the wave is a boss wave, and there's a chance that to get 1 Iron Bar after killing a mob, allowing them to buy tools, weapons, foods, armour, and more to fight against someHostile MobsincludingCave Golems,Draugr Zombies,Draugr Skeletons,Frost Golems,Frost Zombies,Frost SkeletonsandDraugr Knights. Killing them gives the player XP, which can allow them enchant their armour and weapons. When a wave starts, there are colored clay to show where the enemies are coming from.
Players spawn in the middle of the building with 10 Coal, as well as a NPC with the "TraderOne" skin named "Upgrades" at the corner.
Players will spawn inside the default lobby. After 60 seconds (or less), the game will start as long as there are at least only 2 players. As long as there are 5 players in the lobby, it becomes full and the game will begin 20 seconds later.
The Shop, also known as Upgrades, is where players will buy items to aid in battle. There are 3 sections in the Shop: Basics, Food, and Potions.
Last Stand has only one map: LastStandBox.
LastStandBox (Last Stand's only Map) is a box with 4 hallways with lava at the end where mobs spawn. It is enclosed by with decorated walls showing the snowland style. The only other Blocks in it are four different tiers of theEnchantment Tables(4 being Wood, Iron, Gold, and Diamond), and a Trader that allows you to purchase upgrades to get stronger.
You should buy Bows over Crossbows, as Bows are quicker and do not have to be charged for longer. Moreover, Crossbows deal the same amount of damage for a slower reload, and the most DPS (damage per second) from a bow is not fully charging it.
A bow is fine if you can aim your shots, and is especially good when you're being bogged down with a herd of mobs. Shoot quick to get rid of them quicker, as not fully charging it is now better than fully charging every shot.
Lava trapping can be done if mobs are chasing you, not recommended to be done when mobs are still spawning in. Should be done with a coconut/speed pot if the mobs are fast (this is in the later waves where the mobs seem to get faster).
In general, prioritize ranged weapons. Max out your crossbow/bow and then get armor. Swords are out of the question as it is impossible to win a war of attrition against opponents that outnumber and outclass you unless you can deal damage without being hurt yourself.
If you have iron, buy lots of fireballs. This will aid you in waves withCave Golems/Frost GolemsandDraugr Knights, since the former has high health and the latter is swift and deals devastating damage and knockback, and both spawn in high numbers and in dense groups. If you are low on health, buy instant-healing potions, since they heal four times as much as an apple for triple the price.
For some reason,Draugr Skeletons/Frost Skeletonsattack other mobs if they are in the way of their target, and will continue shooting unless that mob is killed! Use this to your advantage. In waves whereDraugr Skeletons/Frost Skeletonsspawn, get a zombie or a golem between you and the skeletons—theDraugr Skeletons/Frost Skeletonswill continuously fight with the other mobs instead of players!
Most mobs focus on a single player and chase them nonstop. You can use this and lure them to gang up on a single player andfireballthem.
Use V to zoom in on large groups of enemies (on Computers). Focus on a specific enemy until that is killed. Risky when mobs spawn from multiple directions unless your teammates can cover your sides.
This gamemode has some of the strongest mobs that can't naturally spawn.
The lava at the end cannot damage you.
You can use all four Enchantment Tables.
The trader disappears once you lose the round.
This game has the highest drop rate for iron bars in the whole game for zombies, getting 1 every 6+ kills.
There was a bug where you can launch a fireball at a wall which causes it to break, allowing you to go outside and view theFrozen Badland. However, this bug only lasted for a day before it got patched.
The mobs always go forward, while not attacking mobs. This can be lured into the lava, allowing you to kill them without being hit due to the AI's buggy code.

--- Page 181: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Level_Up_Bar ---
The level up bar is a bar that increases when you earn XP by killingmobs,farming,mining, or doing other tasks that give XP. It was added in theenchanting update.
The level up bar has a green outline with a black filling inside.
A Level Up Bar Showing at 2 Levels
When you die by a player or mob, your level up bar gets set to half of its previous level.  When you kill someone, your level up bar increases by the amount they lost. If you pass a level, stars appear around the level you are currently in representing celebration for passing a level and a sound is played. The bar increases when earning XP, and can reach as high as level 300.
The max level is 300 so if you try to obtain more XP, you will still have 300 XP.
The XP is known as "Aura XP", possibly a reference to present-day memes known as "brainrot".
There was a glitch allowing the player to gain infinite XP by right clicking any Fully Grown Wheat or Fully Grown Rice.

--- Page 182: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Lifesteal ---
Hardcoreis a feature available inopen-worldWorlds. It adds a few advanced features to the game if enabled. It is more commonly known by its lifesteal feature, therefore claiming the nicknameLifesteal.

To enableHardcore, the owner of the world must type /toggle hardcore in the chat. After that, they can use /hardcore to see a list of commands available with hardcore mode now enabled.
Note: Brackets means that the argument is required, while the parentheses stands for an optional requirement.
This command sets the aloud of time a player gets banned after getting killed, in hours. If enabled, the default value of this feature is 16 hours. If set to zero, the player will instantly spawn after getting killed. If disabled, the player will simply be banned forever.
This command toggles whether the players' health points regenerates automatically after a certain period.
This command toggles whether the owne gets banned as well after getting killed. It is highly recommended to be turned off if either lifesteal is enabled or tempban is disabled.
To enable or disable lifesteal, the owner types "/hardcore lifesteal [health point[1]]" into the chat. A zero will disable lifesteal. A value greater than zero will result in a player losing that many health points to their killer after dying. It is recommended for the value to be set between 5 and 20 for a more enjoyable experience.

--- Page 184: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Loading_Screen ---
When the player is entering anygamemodein Bloxd.io, they can see the Loading Screen.
The Loading Screen has a Blurred Image of a Bloxd build in the background. There is a big rotatingBobhead in the foreground with two messages below. One message tells you the progress of your game loading (former loading screen, now bob’s head is round, and a blue line orbiting it.) The other type of messages can be found below these and are written in a smaller font. This message is called a Loading Dialogue and is meant to entertain you while you are waiting for the game to load. A new message will appear if you click on the screen.
The current loading screen
The Loading Process has five to seven stages:
Finding Lobby
Stand By… (When you are not yet joining the game… Also, most of the ads (advertisements) are in this section. This doesn't always appear.)
Loading Game
Loading Assets
Joining Lobby (Often takes the most time and causes the most problems because of data-processing issues. If you screen hangs at this stage for too long, it may indicate a loss of connection or other internal errors.)
Loading Player Info
Loading World
When you are entering the game, it will say: “Loading Game” (This also costs the most time.)
Notes:
There is an additional message that may appear while joining. It is "Game is updating...". This only appears if the game received an update recently. It's recommended to refresh your page if you see this.
The loading screen may switch to a different loading screen for a few seconds before the "loading player" info and "loading world" messages. This screen is blue and black with a white Pacman in the middle. This only appears from time to time.
In addition, a black panel may appear over the loading screen. This is a verification feature that asks you whether you are a Human or anIron Watermelon. Just click in the human-verification box next to this message and you'll continue joining.
And below it, there are currently 97 Loading Dialogues, arranged by order. As of 5/18/2025:

Notes
Once you reach the last message, you will get the first message again if you click it again.
↑1.01.11.2This is a reference to theIron Watermelon. It used to jump scare players who went too far away from spawn when the game was still new.
↑2.02.1Messages 21 and 22 are not true. You can fly in Creative even if you're not logged in.
↑This is due to many players complaining about removedGame Modesthat lost in game votes.
↑This is a reference toDirty Flea Sack.
↑This is becauseDirty Flea Sackoften makes a mistake when making new updates resulting in Bloxd being temporarily down. Dirty Flea Sack's Discord profile image is a cat.
↑This was a hint to players to find the secret areas in Pirates.
↑This is a hint that in the future, the devs would add night to bloxd.
The old loading screen had a blue background and less loading dialogues. It also didn't have the verification panel.

5Trivia
Lucky Towers is a Gamemode that was added to Bloxd.io on: September 19, 2024. In this gamemode, about 12 players spawn on their own tower. The goal of the game is to be the last player standing on a tower. You have to knock people off, either by using PvP, projectiles, accidentally falling off themselves (but this one is rare as you normally won't "accidentally fall off"), or dying to the floor rising.
A few items have been renamed in this gamemode such as the stick and pebble. You randomly receive an Item every few seconds. These can beBlocks,Saplings,Armor,Tools,Foodor any of the special Items listed below.  Fireballs, RPGs, and other Rocket Spleef items can be obtained but there are no Moonstone Orbs. Use what you get to protect yourself from falling off and try to make other players fall off instead.
Explosive
(Jump Boost)
There are 5 different events that can happen at random:
Items can spawn 2 times faster for a limited time.
All players get a Jump Boost for a limited time.
The floor will begin to rise. When the floor reaches you, you will die. It doesn’t work if you used the Respawn Stick.
A random chest spawn with good loot. Either it spawns at -20, 0, 20, or at y=50.
A bombardment will be heading at you withExplosivesat multiple spots.
Here is the list of ways to win in most of the maps:
Don't use Snowdash if you don't have to; if you do use it, time it right or you'll die.
Save Updraft, so that if you ever get a Floor Creator, use your Updraft to move into "space" faster and further away from everyone else, and after your velocity is almost at 0, use the Floor Creator as a platform.
Don't get complacent after knocking a player down to the "dead" floor, because they might have a Respawn Stick and knock you down there.
Don't drink Chaos Potion if you are low on health, because if you receive a good Effect, it will also inflict a bad Effect (possibly Poison or Weakness) and might make you die faster—either by Players or your Effects.
Take your Planks to make a Workbench and open it up to craft essential Items like the Respawn Stick or some Weapons.
Don't skip out on Food items because you might need them. For example, Melon Slice can make you invisible and will help you successfully prank your opponents.
If you have gravity-based Items, measure to get the most accurate throw.
If you have any tools that are not Axes or Swords, do not throw them away because they can deal melee damage too.
Chaos Potion has a chance to have 2 good effects (one of which is mandatory, Knockback, and another good effect that will randomly appear).
In some events, the ground will start to rise—so try to get a Floor Creator and as many Updrafts as you can so you can go up and then set a platform down.
Jump Potions will be given to players who are in the game—take advantage of this to jump to lower or higher towers that are occupied by players.
Don't rush over others, as the distance is too long and you will lose reach and fall into the Void. Place some Blocks towards the player you want to kill.
Use Updrafts to fly higher.
Use Vines to get to other players and quickly place four Blocks in the four directions of the Vines to block others from going up. Another trick is destroy the vines around you.
Get some Vines to get moving.
Mine the Logs in your tower and turn them to Planks for triple the amount of Blocks! Using this method, you can tower up much higher.
Don't be foolish enough to jump over other towers without watching the angle.
You can jump over other towers with Ice Blocks!
Snowdash could cause freezing in older versions if you throw it at yourself. Now it's fixed and it will boost you the way your character is facing
In the second thumbnail of this gamemode, the player is holding White Ceramic. The player's name may have been covered or it may have been erased or it may not have been named.
If you have a Workbench, you can make your Snow Blocks into Snowdash, Messy Stone into Updraft, Wood Planks into Respawn Sticks and a lot more. Use it now, because once Arthur sees this, high chances are it'll get patched (Also use saplings to make many Respawn Sticks). (now Respawn Sticks also need Updraft to craft)
You can craft an Updraft with 4 Messy Stone and 1 Glass.
You can't place Floor creators above y=100.
All Lucky Tower items can be obtained inWorldsexcept the Respawn Stick and the Steal Ball.
This gamemode has been inspired by the gamemodePillars of FortuneinMinecraft.

By right-clicking on theMailboxwith abook, the book is transferred from the player's hand into theMailbox. A yellow line will appear under the insertion hole, telling the owner that there is mail inside. They can then simply right-click on the mailbox to take out the mail. As of right now, players can only putbooksin theMailbox. The maximum amount of mail a singleMailboxcan hold is ten.
Thisblockis mainly used inOne BlockandGreenville, due to players not being able to edit another player's land or island. It is also popular in openworldsbecause you can send mail, even if a player is offline. They also give a great opportunity to troll and chat with your friends or other people.
If a Mailbox is placed within a protected chunk, you can only place books in it and are not able to take out books other players placed
Mailboxes work similarly to Bookshelves.

There is also a random username option, which gives you a random default username made out of an adjective followed by a noun and 7 numbers.
The default usernames are given to any new rookie opening Bloxd and they are two words followed up with numbers (e.g FranticVampire3543022). The ones inboldare rare default names. The ones initalic(in the "Old Usernames" section) are newer names that were added on to the single-word name scheme later on. Default usernames can be:

This is good for Bloxd players who haven't joined the Bloxd Discord server or don't check the dev-log there. The Update Log works like a timeline, starting with the addition of the Update Log.
The update log as of 5 September, 2024
The Update Log was added on 14 August 2024. As the name suggests, the Update Log is used to keep track of recent changes for the players to see. The Update Log was added as a part of a very minor homepage change, which replaced the large Discord Logo with the buttons for the information, the Update Log and the Discord.

Arthuris the creator ofBloxd.io. He is from the United Kingdom. Arthur once worked for Microsoft. When he found out that Microsoft was buying Minecraft, he quit the company and created his own game based on Minecraft. Arthur created the game engine via Noa (a free and open source game engine). Ayaan, an unknown coder, also helped Arthur on the development of the game.
The first game made with the Bloxd.io game engine wasBloxd Hop(formerly know as BloxdHop) byWeiqing. Arthur is friends with Mattzap. Arthur has also created over 15gamemodesforBloxd. He writes the updates he rolls out toBloxdon its Discord Server in the #dev-log channel in theBloxd Discord Server.
Dirty Flea Sack leaked how Arthur chooses new devs (starting from Stardue).
The “dev” (still unofficial) makes a game mode, it was added to a game as a lonely LTM for a few hours.
Arthur looks at the feedback of the game mode.
The “dev” soon creates another game mode, and it gets in a vote with the old one.
Then the dev becomes official.
WeiqingWeiqing's Discord profile picture.GamemodesBloxd Hop(Partially)
Weiqingwas the initial developer ofBloxd Hop.Arthurfirst started working onBloxd.ioand then invited Weiqing to make Bloxd Hop using the Bloxd game engine. Bloxd Hop was the first publicly available bloxd.io game, dubbing Weiqing as one of the first creators of the game.
Weiqing and Arthur probably made the first game modeBloxd Hoptogether. Arthur gave Weiqing authority over Bloxd Hop, and Arthur worked behind the scenes making the bloxd game engine. After a while, Arthur took over development ofBloxd Hop, fixing bugs and keeping it up to date with the rest of the bloxd game engine.MattzapMattzap's Discord profile picture.GamemodesOne Block,Greenville,Murder Mystery,The Pit
Mattzapis a friend ofArthur. He was the 3rd developer ofBloxd.io. He created fourgamemodesas of  but now he works on a game that he created called "mageclash.io". Mattzapp normally createdLimited Time Modes.
Mattzap appears inOne Blockevents, where you have to type or unscramble his name first.
Mattzap is now a "Business Dev".
Mattzap now no longer maintainsGreenville,Oneblock, andMurder Mysteryas he left Bloxd. Instead, those gamemodes are maintained by the Bloxd Team.
Starduestardue's Discord profile picture.GamemodesSky Wars,Prison,Plots,andRush Racing

Starduewas one of the developers of Bloxd along withArthur. She joined the Bloxd discord server on November 6, 2023, but first talked 2 days later (November 8) in the dev-log channel. She helpedArthurwith the coding and development of the game. She left the Bloxd team on around November 7, 2024.
stardue says I suck :(
When I showed the message she said "I never said that"
stardue is a liar
"I can complete portal with my eyes closed" -stardue
"ill be having a bad day and come play through portal" -stardue
or gamedev tycoon but thats a bit trippy
Stardue created a few items: TheCompass. It is made for her own game mode,Sky Wars, which points to the nearest player alive (everyone gets it after 7 minutes or until there are only 2 alive players left) TheBook, which if you craft, it will say "Arthurstinks -stardue" on the last page. (this feature is now gone), theName Tagwhich can rename non-stackable items,Boatswhich are a really excellent way to travel, Cotton and theHang Glider.
It was shown that she somewhat acquaintsArthur. Lots of her work show that she acquaints him, butArthursomehow still has her hired as a developer, even keeping her ''mean'' easter eggs.
Some of theLoading ScreenMessages mentioned her. She is the second developer who was mentioned in it (The first one isArthur, even Mattzap is not mentioned.)

Like Watermelons, Melons can be crafted into 4 Melon Slices Which then can be turn into Gold Melon Slices with a Gold Bar.
Melon Slices are eaten to make the player invisible for 12 Seconds.
Gold Melon Slices are eaten to make the player invisible for 18 Seconds
An Iron Watermelon
TheIron Watermelonhas an extremely small chance of spawning instead of a Watermelon when it grows, and can be crafted into 128 Iron Bars.
We still don't know the chance for an Iron Watermelon to grow, but it is speculated to be about 1 in 10000 chance of a Watermelon to spawn as an Iron Watermelon.
The Iron Watermelon is supposedly the first mob to be added as it would jumpscare you if you were to far away from it, but this feature was removed, and the Iron Watermelon Block still remains in the game.

5Trivia
Messy Stoneis a commonblockobtained from miningStone. It is mainly used for crafting or as a buildingblock.
Messy Stone is gray and looks like Stone but with a bit of messiness to it. Individual pebbles can be seen in the block’s texture.
The shades of gray that appear in Messy Stone’s texture are darker than in the texture for Stone.
Messy Stone can be mined with aPickaxe, in which case it drops itself. If mined without a Pickaxe, it drops nothing. Messy Stone is dropped byStonewhen mined with a Pickaxe (except with aMoonstone Pickaxe, in which case it drops itself).
Andesite, Diorite, or Granite does NOT drop Messy Stone, as they drop themselves.
Messy Stone can be used as a basic buildingblock, as it is extremely common. Note that mostStoneitemscan also be crafted withStone, Granite, Diorite, or Andesite.
Mega Compressed Messy Stone has so much Messy Stone in it that it cannot be crafted back into Messy Stone without aChest, and even then, you'd need 15 Chests to store it all.
Messy Stone can be bought inGreenvillefor 1Coin,and inFactionswith 500 for 70Coins(60Coinsif you're on the Airship). It'll take you 74,480Coins(63,840 on the Airship) to buy enough Messy Stone for 1 Mega Compressed Mega Stone, and could be sold for 31,860Coins(42,480 on the Airship), with 441 Messy Stone left over. (please verify math)
If you had an auto-miner with maximum efficiency (no time wasted on not mining) and aMoonstone Pickaxe, you'd be getting enough for 1 Mega Compressed Messy Stone every 1.5 days. If you're mining with a Diamond pickaxe it would take 2 days. (please verify math)
One stack of Mega Compressed Messy Stone is 530,909,559 normal Messy Stone.

MinigamesInfoDescriptionFast-paced, never-ending, one-minute minigamesDeveloperunknownScript Nameminigames
Not to be confused withMinigame Competition Winners
Minigamesis a secret gamemode made by an unknown developer and leaked on March 27th that focuses on a fast-paced minigame aspect. It was later added on the front page on that day as a gamemode onStaging.bloxd.io, but was removed from the front page 5 days later on April 1st.
In this gamemode, you spawn in a glass block cage above the minigames, unless you join when a new minigame is starting. After the minigame ends, you will be be teleported to one random minigame, from the available list. You will have to survive 1 minute in the minigame to go on to the next minigame.
Special text appears in the chat for starting a game, dying, winning, survivors that won, and more. There's a user interface on the right of the screen which shows the minigame, the time remaining, and special text for individual gamemodes. When you die, you will teleport back into the glass box until the 60 seconds or less are over with a message below the UI saying "YOU ARE DEAD :(".
In this gamemode, there are 3 minigames that get randomly picked with 2 maps from Hide And Seek that are chosen:
Where You Hand 
Over Your Infection 
To Other People
Like Map Where
The Floor Disappears
After Standing On It
One Shot Gun (M1911) 
And Shoots Eachother
(Cooldown Is Modified)
LikeNatural Disaster Survival, this gamemode was leaked due to adeveloperjoining the game which made the peoplefriendsjoining the lobby.
Because everyone inOne in the Chamberhas only 1 hp, you can freelyinstallkill a player without using the One Shot Gun.
This gamemode is pretty similar to most minigames games (ex: epic minigames on roblox).
Unlike most gamemode, Minigames goes on forever and will only stop when nobody is in the lobby.
The gamemode itself is very easy to access via like this one:https://bloxd.io/game/minigames
This gamemode is only available to be joined via links, with thefriendslist or onStaging.
The One Shot Gun is actually it's own item that has a 5-7 seconds cooldown and only shoots 1 bullet that does 1 damage.
This gamemode was added shortly after its leak on theStagingwebsite.
5 days after it's arrival, the gamemode got removed from theStagingwebsite.
This gamemode is similar toSquid Game.

--- Page 201: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Mobs ---
A Mobis a AI-driven game entity resembling a living creature. The term "mob" is short for "mobile entity". All mobs can be attacked and even hurt (from being either attacked by a player or from another mob, falling into the void, or hit by a projectile, etc), and have some form of voluntary movement. Different types of mobs have different AI, from just simply walking around randomly to shooting arrows at players. There are currently only 17 mobs in Bloxd.io so far.

6Trivia
A Mob can spawn naturally but only depending on the biome, or it can be spawned manually by just using Code Blocks or Spawn Orbs, and mob spawn blocks. (mainly by just using creative though!)
(See all inMob Spawn Orb)
Mob Spawn Orbs were added on: December 12, 2024. They function like Spawn Eggs inMinecraft, You can throw them at the place where you want to spawn the mob. There are currently 17 different types of spawn orbs:
PigSpawn Orb
CowSpawn Orb
SheepSpawn Orb
DeerSpawn Orb
StagSpawn Orb
WolfSpawn Orb
Cave GolemSpawn Orb
Draugr ZombieSpawn Orb
Draugr SkeletonSpawn Orb
Frost GolemSpawn Orb
Frost ZombieSpawn Orb
Frost SkeletonSpawn Orb
Draugr KnightSpawn Orb
BearSpawn Orb
Gold Watermelon StagSpawn Orb
WildcatSpawn Orb
GorillaSpawn Orb
Other spawn orbs will likely be added when new mobs are released. They are currently available inCreative,Plots, andWorlds. There is a mob limit per chunk, so you cannot spawn more than 4 mobs in each if you try to spawn any more mobs it won’t work at all even in creative.
(See all onMob Spawner)

Mob spawnerswere added on April 17, 2025. They function like spawners inMinecraft, You can place them at the place where you want them to spawn the certain mob. There are currently 17 different mob spawners, shown below.
Note:Boldspawn cages mean they can be collected in the wild.

You can mine these hostile spawmers with a moonstone pickaxe to acquire them in your inventory if you want.
A mob can be passive, hostile or neutral. A passive mob will run away when hit. A hostile mob will charge towards the player, if they are close enough, and do not go away no matter how many times hit. Keeping some distance is the only way to cancel their chasing behavior. A neutral mob ignores the player unless it is attacked. When a neutral mob is attacked, it's behavior will become similar to a hostile mob's. A Mob does not purposely fall into pits or caves unless it is pushed into it.
Was added on November 20, 2024, the Pig is the game's first mob. Pigs spawn naturally in thee ForestBiome(rare), Plains Biome (common), and Meadows Biome (common).

In early versions of the game, when it wasn't fully developed, a jumpscare called the Iron Watermelon would allegedly appear on a player's screen when they went at least 6000 blocks away from spawn in any direction. Its purpose was to warn players to return, as chunk loading was poor at that time. Today, theIron Watermelon(item) is a very rare item with a 0.01% drop chance (1 in 10,000 watermelons) and can be grown from a watermelon stem.
Legend has it that in lobbies Survival -1 and Creative -1, there is a mob called V0ID. V0ID was supposedly banished there by one of the game’s creators,Mattzap. V0ID reportedly distorts players' screens, making it hard to see. Many YouTubers, such asMMC Gaming and SUDIFROMYT, have made videos about this mysterious entity.
The "Bloody Cave Golem" doesn’t really have a name but it has been seen by a player named Blistrax and his friend Ethanplayzz78, a little YouTuber namedCazozozopis currently investigating.
From left to right; Iron Watermelon, V0ID, and Bloody Cave Golem.

Mobs despawn after the player unloads the chunks they are in or after a period of time.
Some mobs run way faster than the player.
The pig’s health was increased from 40 HP to 76 HP, requiring two hits with a Diamond Sword to kill.
Cows have approximately 100 HP, as it takes 25 punches to kill them.
Cows run pretty fast, but a bit slower than pigs.
Mobs used to not move on their own and often fell into nearby caves.
Previously, pigs did not receive damage from damage dealers like spikes. Now they do.
Mobs sometimes drop more than one food item due to increased drop rates.
Passive mobs now turn their head in the direction they will move next. They also run away from players after being hit.
If shot with a gun, mobs receive massive knockback, usually sending them flying.
Potions used to have no effect on mobs. This was changed on May the 2nd, as part of the Frozen Badlands update.
Mobs do not bounce on Fat Mushrooms.
Draugr Knights are the first ones to ever jump while trying to kill players.
You get a Jump Boost when you get hit by aGoldwatermelon Stagmaybe because when it dies, it drops Gold Watermelon Slice, when eaten it will gain that effect.
TheWolfdoesn't drop anything when killed. However, you get aura XP from them.
One interesting thing aboutWolfis that when you look at them, their heads will turn back and forth.
Deerhave a small amount of health so using Diamond Sword (no enchant) to kill them only takes 1 hit.
Furdropped after you killBear. These can be used to craft fur armor.

Moonstoneis a magical resource used to craft many different Items, like the MoonstoneBlock,Moonstone Orb,Moonstone Pickaxe,Moonstone Chestand theMoonstone Explosive. TheMoonstone Axewas removed for quite some time but it’s now added back again, but moonstone swords don’t exist in game. You can find Moonstone Ore underground at exactly y -85 only, which will drop 1 Moonstone when mined.
Moonstone Ores will only spawn on y = -85, and Blocks of type "rock" (Stone, Diorite, Andesite, Granite) (although the Ore will look the same - stone appearance even spawning in stone variants) in this interval have a 0.5% chance of being replaced with Moonstone Ore, after which another attempt will be made to spawn moonstone within 2 Blocks of the spawned Moonstone. There are at least 40 Blocks between two Moonstone deposits. The deposits can contain up to 8 Moonstone Ore. Diamonds have a 10% chance of replacing Stone a few Blocks below Moonstone. Therefore, the best way to mine them is around Y -86 and checking below Moonstone within 15 blocks of it. There are also some chances Gold Ore will be near Moonstone Ore. UsingMoonstone Explosivesto mine is also a good idea, as you can break much more Blocks and will therefore give you much more opportunities to find Ores.
Moonstone can also be obtained in the form of Moonstone Fragments. These drop after killing aCave Golem. 9 Moonstone Fragments can be crafted into 1 Moonstone in the Workbench.

AMoonstone Axecan break blocks up to 7 blocks above the block that is currently being mined. They cannot break blocks that can't be broken by Axes easily, likeStoneandNatural Soils. The blocks have to be connected to be broken. For example, if there is a Stone Block in the way to a Wood Planks that is within range, it will not get mined.
When the Moonstone Axe was first released, it could mine up to 8 blocks instead of 6.
For the previous 2 years, theMoonstone Axewas unused and unobtainable before it was added as a new tool.
If you mine any type of blocks with theMoonstone Axe, and there are 5 more blocks above it that can be broken by an axe, those will break too, as if the axe is affecting both the block you hit and the 5 above it.

Throw a Moonstone Orb to teleport to its landing location. However, you will take 20 damage when it lands, no matter thearmoryou wear. If you throw multiple, you can be killed if you are in survival mode.
Before the game added damage to Moonstone orbs, you can throw as many as you can without any cooldown / drawbacks.
Multiple Moonstone Orbs can be thrown, and they will all teleport you to the landing location, however this is really risky because spamming more than five Orbs will kill you if you are in survival mode.
Moonstone Orbs slowly sink underwater, when it eventually lands, the player will still be teleported. This can be used for stasis chambers. (However, it will despawn after one minute since it is considered a projectile, so it’s not a preferred method.)
Moonstone Orbs can be propelled further withMoonstone Explosivesalthough you will need some good timing.
In oldSky Wars, you could get them in chests before the chest loot rebalance.
There is aglitchwhere a Moonstone Orb works like a Snowball and doesn't despawn.
Previously, Moonstone Orb did no damage per throw, then it changed to dealing 40 damage per throw, again when it changed to only dealing 30 damage per throw and the all the way down to 20 damage per throw.

After the food update (unofficial name), the moonstone pickaxe mines melons and watermelons, making them drop the block instead of 4 slices, sacrificing harvesting speed for inventory space.
It is the fastest mining pickaxe. It mines stone for 0.25 seconds while a diamond pickaxe mines for 0.35 seconds.
Most players are either on the Moonstone Pickaxe side for Stone, or the Diamond Pickaxe side for Messy Stone.

Movements are things you can do inBloxdsuch as sprinting, bunny hopping and crouching etc.
There is currently one mechanic based on Movement. This list contains all types of of the current in-game mechanics:
Horizontal movement refers to movement specifically in a horizontal direction.
It has many varieties in speed. The following table shows the parameters of various horizontal movements, and after it the types of movement themselves are described in more detail.
In blocks per second
Percentage (relative to walking)
In blocks per second
Percentage (relative to walking)
Everyone can do this. It is done by pressing "W" or the up-arrow key alone with nothing. Or use the joystick on touch to walk.
Press [↑Shift] on computer along with "W" or the up-arrow key. Or use the joystick on touch to sprint.
Press [CAPS LOCK], [ctrl], [Z] or [C] on computer to crouch. Or use the down arrow key on touch to crouch. You can enable/disable crouch-toggling in settings.
Bunny hopping (Called B-Hop In-Game) is one of the hardestparkourskills. You need to jump right as you land to increase the jump length. The lengths that you can jump with bunny hopping technique are 6 Block, 7 block (requires double B-hop) and 9 block in ice.
This is the setup for 6 block jumps
Double b-hop is a b-hop after a b-hop making the boost even greater, but also requires the player to land in the edge of the block in the first jump. It allows you to perform 7 block jumps.
The setup of double b-hop
In the tips ofbloxd.io, there is one saying you can actually do b-hop 3 times in a row making the maximum speed possible without buffs. It is done by b-hopping 3 times. It allows you to make the tightest jumps possible in Bloxd.io such as 6.5 neos.
You should know by jumping after you land gives a speed boost, according to the DYKs.
By sprinting then doing the jump boost it’s even faster.
Jumping occurs by pressing the space key. Jumping can be enhanced withjumping potionsfrom 1 to 3 or even 7 blocks.
Climbing is achievable on ladders (both normal and Iron), vines (which is recommended when you go mining because it grows on ANY surface), and trapdoors. Use the joystick on touch to climb.
These are jumps in which something pushes you upward.
The jumps themselves and their height are shown in the following table.
(without armour)
Jumping during a consumable explosion will make the flight altitude even higher. For maximum height gain, you must press [Space] in an instant before the explosion.
Just fighting. Click LMB on an enemy or touch the player on touch.
Place a block by selecting your cursor on a block and then right-clicking. For touch tap the place you want to place the block as long as the block you place is touching another block.
Interact with a block, such as doors, workbenches, boards or grass with shears. Aim your crosshair at the block, then right-click. For touch, simply tap the item.
Place blocks to navigate through air by looking backwards at your blocks.
Just breaking blocks. Click on the block you want to break and hold until the block is gone. If you use the right tool, or if the block is obtainable, it will drop itself. Cracks will appear in the block to show how long it will take to break. Press on the block on touch to break it.
Glitchesexplains this but press [Alt] and [Tab↹] while mining for this to work.
Double jump also known as DJ is possible when even one block of water is placed. When you are inside the water, spam jump to jump WAY much higher, works best on downhill slopes but also works on flat areas and also uphill areas though it is a bit harder and more useless.
Yes, you CAN triple jump in Bloxd.io. This can also be done in Minecraft. It is done by placing blocks, making it OP inBedwarsandSky Wars.
Jump, place a block and jump again to jump two blocks.
Then aim your cross hair towards bottom front.
Quickly place an "L" shape of vertical blocks.
Jump on the higher section.
You have jumped three blocks.
The "L" shape makes it easier to line it up, you can do it with a pillar, but it is more advanced.
You can do this and turn around to surprise your enemies with this skill.
Head hitters include jumping, and sprint-jumping.
By jumping in a 1 by 2 tunnel and walking you go pretty fast, with ice it’s even faster. This mechanic is useful during a chase in Open World or Bedwars, however they could use your tunnel and catch up.
By sprint jumping is even faster.
Ladder Launching is a very old bug. It launches you very  high. The more ladders you put in the same spot, the higher you get launched.
There are a few steps to perform this launch.
Block hitboxes highlighted with red.
3-block set-up
Put laddersone facing towards you and the other one facing towards your left in the block next to the first ladder (to the left).Other ladder arrangement optionsshown in the galleryare also available.
Put solid blocksabove/ next to (if the ladder is on the block you want to launch) the previous placed ladders.
Add a ladder behind the first one(I think you can skip this step since this does not increase the height of the jump).
Place yourself in the cornerof the ladders aiming at them, thenhold jump key([Space]key by default) andcrouch key([C],[Caps Lock], or[Ctrl]by default).
Wait for about 5 secondsto gain potential energyto jump on max height.
Press[W]key(default forward key) and quickly release crouch and hold sprint key ([Shift]key by default) (releasing the crouch and pressing sprint is optional, this is just necessary so as not to fly back).
*Yes, the jump height has been rechecked many times, 2 and 3 ladders setups show the same result.
A high jump is also possible from a single ladder (trapdoor) in a similar way. The jumping characteristics of single and double ladders are presented in the following table.
Plum Ladder, Pear Ladder, Aspen Ladder
Also, if you wait the longer time on the ladder, it launches you higher
*Note this is actually not proved, so we still need to do experiments to test if there are anything wrong on the table.

AWritableis an Item that you can write on. There are currentlythreefour in the game:Boards,Books,Name Tag, and Code Blocks.WritablesA Name Tag, Book and Board

The Board, with the special arrow symbol on it (type -> on board)
TheBoardis a special transparentBlockthat can be used to store text. Boards can convert the symbols->and<-into these symbols:→and←as seen on the right, but they're patched due to new font settings. The text has three sizes: small, medium and large. This helps to convey messages differently, as if you want to warn about something or title something, you can use the large size, or if you are writing a long username or a short paragraph about something, you would use the small size. If your word is too long the text will go to the next row, even if the word is not complete.
Boards appear as a thin, rectangular prism with the MapleWoodPlanks texture on it.
You write on a Board by pressing[E]or right-clicking while aiming at it. A new UI appears that allows you to type choose from the three text sizes. Click on the side of the Board to publish what you wrote. It is possible to put emojis on Boards.
If you are the owner of an OpenWorld, you can create special Boards that activate when you[Right-Click]or press[E]. There are nine types of boards: 'press to get' Boards, 'press to lobby' Boards, 'press to tp' Boards, 'press to buy' Boards, 'press to mode' Boards, 'press to damage' Boards, 'press to execute' Boards, 'press to message' Boards and 'press to sell' Boards. If you have multiple Special Boards next to each other, they will all activate, unless one fails to activate ( for "press to buy/sell", not having enough items to buy/sell ) then the chain will activate up to that sign but not past. You can edit 'Press to __' Boards by Right Clicking/Pressing "E".
A press to get Board behaves similarly to command Blocks fromMinecraftwith the /give command. It gives a certain amount of a certain type of Items to the player who presses it. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
If you do not have enough room on one line, such as '999Moonstone Orb', you can put the 'Moonstone Orb' bit on a new line, and it would still work. When typing a specific Item name, be sure to use the correct name, or the Board won't execute the command (e.g. Type 'Block ofDiamond' instead of "diamond block"). Never use the plural form of the item name.
The item name mustn't be a specified number, you can also write for example 1-10 Dirt to give out a random count of items.
A press to lobby Board teleports you to the specified lobby.  To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
This only works in the Worlds gamemode because there is no owner of the public lobbies.  (Note that the "press to" parts are not caps-sensitive)
A press to tp Board teleports you to the specified coordinates. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
A press to buy Board allows
to buy a certain thing for a certain price. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
A press to sell Board allows users to sell a certain thing for a certain price. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
Added on December 10, 2024 (however it was possible to do before, it just wasn't listed anywhere as a function), this board is used to sell all the items in your inventory to buy nothing, replacing the old feature where you had place many chests just to perform the same effect
Added on December 10, 2024, this board is used to randomize the number of items you can collect when you press the board.
Takes health from a player that presses it.
Added on December 10, 2024, this table is used to change your mode.

These Boards can be created in all other game modes with Boards by anyone.

Similar to a press to buy Board, but it must be placed on a Chest and the Chest must contain the Items that will be bought.
Similar to a press to sell Board, but it must be placed on a Chest and the Chest must contain the Items that will be paid.
Press to execute boards can execute other boards that are at the position we provide. Like most boards functions, execute boards can only be made by an owner of a lobby.
Added on December 10, 2024, this board is used for chatting, when clicked it will show messages from Lobby Msg (msg is Message).

If special boards are beside each other the effect chains together.
Boards were the first writable Item in the game.
People used to write press to buy Boards in the lobby after the leak of it resulting to people getting rich.
On August 4, 2024, there was abuginGreenvillewhere items could be obtained using the press to get Board. It was possible to obtainillegal items, which were:Allium, Forget-me-not, Pear Sapling,Bedrock, etc.
In aGreenvilleglitch, you can use Press to get Board to getitemsthat are banned in Greenville (e.g.Fireball, Iceball,Moonstone Explosive), which are very useful as they can be used to breakblocksthat are almost impossible to find (e.g. Emerald Block, Lapis Block, Invisible Solid).
You used not be able to edit a 'Press to __' board after making it, so you would have to destroy it to edit it once again.
If you put a negative value (e.g. -1, -5) into a press to damage board, you will gain health upon pressing it
If you're muted you don't have the ability to chat, but also to use boards and books.
A Book
ABookis an Item used to write text. You can write anything, from stories to guides, or even notes.
A Book looks like it has a leather cover with white, paper pages.
By right-clicking or pressing[E]anywhere while holding a Book in their hand, the player can open a text editor.
Using this UI, the player can write a single Book up to 10 pages long, with up to 247 characters per page. The player can write up to 2,470‌ characters inside the entire Book. No page may be longer than 13 lines and each line can have a width of 19 characters.
A Book can be published by clicking the "Publish" button at the bottom of a Book. Clicking on "Title" at the top of a book will enter the editor for the title of the Book. The Book can later be edited by anyone, by clicking on the "Edit" button. If you are the publisher (the last person to edit the Book), the Book will say that you made the Book, stating "Book by [Player Name]". You can copy/paste from and into the Book. a
Books can be stored inBookshelvesandMailboxes.
This was added along with the Name Tag.
When the Book was added, there was a secret message hidden in the Book left byStardueon the last page of every Book. It read, "Arthur stinks. - Stardue". These messages were removed soon from all Books.
The swear filter exists in Books.
If you create a Book inSkywarsand write on it, it will not save.
If you place a Book in a chest then mine the chest, the book will be empty.
If you have a book containing words and you are killed, all the words in the book will disappear.
Dupe Bookshelf Empty: First, you must have 1 book and 1 Empty Bookshelf, then continuously press the E button or right click, the Empty Bookshelf will fall out continuously.
If you're muted you don't have the ability to chat, but also to use books and boards.
A Name Tag
TheName Tagis an Item that can be used to rename other Items. Name Tags can only rename non-stackable Items, likeFoodandEquipment. The Name Tag is NOT aPlayer Name Tagand cannot renameentities. The descriptions of renamed Items will still stay after renaming them.
The Name Tag can not rename a Name Tag or Book, even though they're not stackable.
If the item that you renamed has been changed, the new name will disappear.
Changing an item includes:
Using aWater Bucketor filling an emptyBucket
Turning a Coconut into aCracked Coconut
Drinking aPotionthat was renamed
Eating Bowl ofRiceorCranberries
The Name Tag appears as a beige tag with a white hook on top.
The UI after right clicking while holding a Name Tag
Right click while holding the Name Tag in your hand. This will send you to an UI that looks somewhat like a Board.
Write the name you want the Name Tag to rename an Item Into.
Click "finish". The renamed Tag will be in your hand, called "Rename to: [Item name]."
In your Inventory, grab it with your mouse and click with it on the Item you want to rename.
Once dropped on the Item, the name tag will disappear, and the Item is renamed.
You cannot rename currently equipped armor.
The Name Tag was added along with the Book.
The Name Tag was created byStardue.
Unlike before, now if you give a renamed Item to a different player, the rename will still be there.
If you die with a renamedItemin yourInventory, the rename will be still there.
The censoring system still exists, so you cannot name anything inappropriate.
Unlike inMinecraft, you can name an Item "Name Tag".
You are able to press enter to make a new row in name tags, making the Item name can go upwards.
The longest discoveredItemname is something like this: ‘**************************$&!’, with a total of 29 characters. You can do this by naming it: "fu fu fu fu fu …" until you run out of space. This will trick the swear system into thinking it is the f word, so it is phrased into *****. “Fu” is 2 characters long, while ***** is 5 characters long. Meaning it will get a 3 extra character bonus, breaking the system.
If you place a Name Tag inside a chest and break the chest, the Name Tag will be empty.
If you place a renamed item into a chest and break the chest, the item name will change back to its default name.

A Grass Block is a naturalBlockthat generates all across the surface of Open Worlds, it’s also one of the most common blocks.
Grass Block is a green Block with light green patches.
A Grass Block can be obtained the fastest by just using aSpadein PlainsBiomes, Forests, and the bottom of mountains.
A Forest Biome.
By just simply using Shears, players can obtain a Grass Block from the Block itself by right-clicking on a Grass Block. The Grass Block will then turn into Dirt and will grow back into a Grass Block later. This makes Grass Blocks infinitely renewable. It will also drop a Grass Block which you pick up and in this way it’s basically farm Grass Blocks. This can be used to expand players'One Blockislands faster, and it can also be used as an infinite Grass Block farm. However- Dirt itself will never turn into a Grass Block no matter what, even if it is touching a Grass Block. This also means that if you need urgent Blocks, you could get lots of Dirt with one Grass Block. (Place a Grass Block, shear it, mine the Dirt, place the new Grass Block you obtained, shear it again ...)
After shearing Grass Blocks, the Grass Block turns into a Block that, in the game’s files, is called Dirt|GrassRoots. This Block drops Dirt when mined. Only Dirt|GrassRoots will ever turn into Grass Blocks.
Grass blocks generate naturally all across the surface of Forests and Plains in thee Open Worlds.
There are also Blocks called Grass and Tall Grass that are transparent Blocks. You can use them to produce/make Wool, Green or Light-Green armor or Wood. They sometimes drop Wheat Seeds when mined. To obtain them, use Shears to mine them.

3Trivia
Obsidianis ablockthat is dark purple in colour and has a few strokes of light purple. It is one of the hardestblocksin thegame.
Previously, Obsidian could be crafted with 4 Magma and 1 bucket of water. But on January 31, 2025, Obsidian can no longer be crafted and must be mixed with water and lava to create Obsidian.
Obsidian is very hard and can't be broken byMoonstone Explosive,Fireballs or Iceballsand is mostly used for defence or decoration. Even with a Diamond Pickaxe, mining lots of Obsidian is a time-consuming process so be careful when making large builds based on Obsidian. However there are some workarounds to this. Simply make your build out of lava by finding a nearby pool and scooping up lava with a bucket, and then either use a river or a fat cactus as a water source and put the water on the lava. This turns your build into obsidian without breaking any which is very time consuming.
InBedwars, Obsidian can be bought with 4Diamondsand can be used to make a powerful bed defense.
Obsidian can also be crafted into an obsidian boat which allows you to boat through lava.
In One Block, there used to be an Obsidianblockunder each player's one block that could be mined and would never regenerate. However, thedevsupdated it. After it is mined, it will regenerate the next time you join. This is also a glitch, since you can break it, rejoin, and it will reappear in that spot.
This item used to be illegal in OpenWorldsuntil they added it on April 9th, 2024 (around 10 AM PDT)

Arthuris the creator ofBloxd.io. He is from the United Kingdom. Arthur once worked for Microsoft. When he found out that Microsoft was buying Minecraft, he quit the company and created his own game based on Minecraft. Arthur created the game engine via Noa (a free and open source game engine). Ayaan, an unknown coder, also helped Arthur on the development of the game.
The first game made with the Bloxd.io game engine wasBloxd Hop(formerly know as BloxdHop) byWeiqing. Arthur is friends with Mattzap. Arthur has also created over 15gamemodesforBloxd. He writes the updates he rolls out toBloxdon its Discord Server in the #dev-log channel in theBloxd Discord Server.
Dirty Flea Sack leaked how Arthur chooses new devs (starting from Stardue).
The “dev” (still unofficial) makes a game mode, it was added to a game as a lonely LTM for a few hours.
Arthur looks at the feedback of the game mode.
The “dev” soon creates another game mode, and it gets in a vote with the old one.
Then the dev becomes official.
WeiqingWeiqing's Discord profile picture.GamemodesBloxd Hop(Partially)
Weiqingwas the initial developer ofBloxd Hop.Arthurfirst started working onBloxd.ioand then invited Weiqing to make Bloxd Hop using the Bloxd game engine. Bloxd Hop was the first publicly available bloxd.io game, dubbing Weiqing as one of the first creators of the game.
Weiqing and Arthur probably made the first game modeBloxd Hoptogether. Arthur gave Weiqing authority over Bloxd Hop, and Arthur worked behind the scenes making the bloxd game engine. After a while, Arthur took over development ofBloxd Hop, fixing bugs and keeping it up to date with the rest of the bloxd game engine.MattzapMattzap's Discord profile picture.GamemodesOne Block,Greenville,Murder Mystery,The Pit
Mattzapis a friend ofArthur. He was the 3rd developer ofBloxd.io. He created fourgamemodesas of  but now he works on a game that he created called "mageclash.io". Mattzapp normally createdLimited Time Modes.
Mattzap appears inOne Blockevents, where you have to type or unscramble his name first.

stardue is a liar
"I can complete portal with my eyes closed" -stardue

One BlockInfoDescriptionStart on a single block and build your island.DeveloperMattzap
One Blockis agamemodethat starts players with oneBlockfloating in the sky with a Block ofObsidianunder it. The player then has to dig up the same Block for different materials. Each time the player mines theBlock, a new one is generated in its place. There are fourteen phases in thisgame mode(listed in "Blocksof each phase"). In a security breach on Feb 12-13 2024, players' islands were reset to an older archive and some even had to restart their whole island, and lost allItems.
You can build in all directions from your One Block. Some players claim there is a border at which you can't expand your island anymore. This is unconfirmed but probably true. Near your One Block, there is an indestructibleDirtplatform with a Portal on it. Through this Portal you get to another platform, this time bigger and made ofStone. There are many portals there. Each Portal leads to a player's Island. Once you reach this place you can:
Press F and immediately teleport to it.
Teleport to other players' islands through the B menu. This is used much more often and is more handy.

If you have around 50 wpm, it's suggested to keep training in case people still have high wpm (e.g. consistently getting around 80-90wpm)
On the 7th of August 2024, an update was made to the messages that appear when an Event happens. It is probably a bug. Some of the messages aren't yellow anymore and the spacing is off.
Placing Blocks
Place the certain Block the fastest of all players in the lobby.
Sand
Dirt
Maple Log
Grass Block
Aspen Wood Planks
The three Diamonds you receive for being the fastest are actually dropped next to you. If your Inventory is full, someone else will be able to pick the Diamonds.
This is a list of all the Phases, the Blocks found in these phases and the approximate percentage each of these types of Blocks represents in each Phase. Note that the tests were done on 5000 Blocks for each Phase, which means there might be minor deviations due to luck.
On the 7th of August 2024, an update was made to the phase descriptions which added/removed the wrong Blocks cited and mentioned Chests in all phases.
↑Hay, Golden Decoration and Coal Ore are cited in the description of the phase Desolation, however, they can't be found in this phase.
There areChestswith loot randomly found in each phase. The initial phases have moreChests, but the loot inside them is slightly less good. The phases Forest and Plains have got much more Wheat than other phases, actually Plains only has Wheat in the Loot Chests. Chances of finding rare Items likeMoonstonein the first phases are even smaller. Similarly, the phase Volcano has more Iron and Gold Bars than other phases.
There are only four available commands in One Block.
/kill[Command 1]
/home[Command 2]
/add [playerUsername][Command 3]
/remove [playerUsername][Command 4]
As you mine your One Block, you get more and more skilled. There are 3 different skills to master: Mining, Digging and Chopping. You start with level 1 in all skills. When you mine, dig and chop, your level in the skills increases (limit is 1000 for each skill).
Using The Skills
Right click with the appropriateToolto activate a skill. When the skill is active, you breakBlocksfaster (like the effect of haste) and you have a chance of dropping 2Blocksinstead of one when breaking it. Each skill has a cooldown of 3 minutes. A higher level means the duration of the skill will be longer and the chance to drop doubleBlockswill be larger.
( Level + 200 ) / 50 seconds
( Level / 100 ) percents
180 seconds - duration of skill
Each skill has its own name and icon (see the icon in the B menu). The icons are at first woodenTools. As the level increases, the icons change toStone,Iron,GoldDiamond.
(displayed when skill
is activated)
*Ultra Dig is called Super Digging in the B menu.
In an update on the 7th of August 2024, the skill names changed to miningSkill, diggingSkill and choppingSkill. This is probably a bug.
A Skill increases slower and slower the higher it is. You need to mine approximately half a million Blocks to get the Mining Skill to 1000. That is if you mine different phases and don't mine on the phases Rainbow or Plenty.
If you would like to get to high mining skills, you should get to the moon phase where you can change phases and set it to underground. Underground is basically all just pickaxe mining only so you can auto-mine and get high levels. Another method is to use the Rainbow stage to mine faster but requires you to mine actively and not offline. See how to do this by checking out the One Block sectionhere:)
Next to your skill level are two square brackets with 10 dashes between them. When you mine, these dashes slowly (one by one) turn into x letters. When all the dashes turn into Xs, your level increases by one and this bar turns back into dashes. This feature is made to show you how much more you need to mine to get to the next level. Once you reach level 1000, these dashes and Xs disappear for this Skill.
You will activate a Skill if you right-click with aPickaxe, Axe or Spade. The Skill will not activate if you open a Chest but it will activate if you use a Workbench or try to write something on a board. If the Skill is on cooldown, you will receive a message "Skill is not ready yet!". You will also receive this message if you right click with aHoe(for example when tilling Grass). This is a bug.
If you are mining a Block when your Skill stops, the mining process will reset to the Block being untouched. This means you'll have to mine this Block like you haven't yet started mining it. Most obvious when miningObsidian.
Mining Blocks with your Diamond Pickaxe works just like in any other game mode. Stone will drop Messy Stone, Coal Ore will drop Coal etc. However, if you activate your mining Skill, there is a chance to get double Blocks. These additional lucky Blocks will drop as if they have been mined with a Moonstone Pickaxe, for example, mining a Diamond Ore with the Skill activated can drop you 1 Diamond and 1 Diamond Ore.
On the other hand, mining with a Moonstone Pickaxe will drop both types of Blocks, Stone and Messy Stone, Ores and minerals, unless you activate the mining skill. It's not clear whether this is a bug or an intentional feature.
Obsidianused to always spawn under your One Block every time you joined. This gave you access to infiniteObsidian, but you had to rejoin every time you mined it. (thisglitchis fixed.)
Pressing [F] will teleport you to the main portal area, but only once you have reached the portal and gone through it.
Notice you teleport up exactly fiveBlocksabove your One Block when using "/home". You can use thisglitchto your advantage by building a giant pillar on top of your One Block, then build or break a block that's 5Blocksabove your One Block to toggle the teleportation. You can create a base that only you can access. You will teleport all the way up to the highest point, or y = 100. (As long as there weren't any 2-Block gaps in the pillar. Sometimes there mustn't be 1 Block gaps either.) Making different floors and jumping down to access them is also a good idea. The tower you build on your One Block can start up to 4 Blocks above your One Block and the teleportation to the top will still work.
Before, rejoining reset your One Block island to aBlockofDirt. This means that a player could get infinite Dirt fast using this mechanic. This is now patched to the lastBlockyou regenerated, although you could still useGrass Blocksfor infiniteDirt.
The full Bookshelf is now considered as one of the rarestBlocksin One Block. They can only be obtained in the Plenty Phase.
After the security breach on 12th Feburary, all players One Block progress got reset to 18750 or less.
You will have to mine 18750 (22500 in older version) Blocks in order to reach the final phase.
One Block was Introduced on February 6th 2023.
The regeneratingBlockused to disappear.
Most blocks mined is currently held by gnarpies with 18 million blocks.
You can destroy the water in the portal usingMoonstone Explosives. However, you need to lag or glitch to be able to place aMoonstone Explosivein One Block. Now you can place the Explosive even without lagging/glitching.
One Block used to be called "OneBlock".
Tall Grass as aChestdrop was added only recently. It existed before too though, due to aglitch.
From August 8, 2024 (or August 9), you can create a One Block lobby inWorlds.
On May 15th 2024, the One Block thumbnail changed, It later changed again on June 15th 2025.
One Block has a seriousbugwhere you can dupe, this bug makes players rich fraudulently. (This was patched; see theCheats & Glitchespage)
↑It makes yourself commit suicide, although you will not lose items on death.
↑It teleports you to your One Block.

One BlockInfoDescriptionStart on a single block and build your island.DeveloperMattzap
One Blockis agamemodethat starts players with oneBlockfloating in the sky with a Block ofObsidianunder it. The player then has to dig up the same Block for different materials. Each time the player mines theBlock, a new one is generated in its place. There are fourteen phases in thisgame mode(listed in "Blocksof each phase"). In a security breach on Feb 12-13 2024, players' islands were reset to an older archive and some even had to restart their whole island, and lost allItems.
You can build in all directions from your One Block. Some players claim there is a border at which you can't expand your island anymore. This is unconfirmed but probably true. Near your One Block, there is an indestructibleDirtplatform with a Portal on it. Through this Portal you get to another platform, this time bigger and made ofStone. There are many portals there. Each Portal leads to a player's Island. Once you reach this place you can:
Press F and immediately teleport to it.
Teleport to other players' islands through the B menu. This is used much more often and is more handy.

One Block WideInfoDescriptionAll you ever wanted. Survival but now with one less dimension.DeveloperUnknown
One Block WidewasLimited Time gamemodeadded on 14 January, 2025, And was removed in a gamemode vote againstDefusal. However,Defusalwas also removed. Most likely, both were too hated to keep. Thisgamemodeis just like any otherSurvivallobby, with one major difference: the world is only one Block wide, making the players unable to travel along the Z axis.One Block Wideused to be calledTwo-Deebut it was later changed because it was too confusing.
The world in this game mode is a one Block wide strip taken out of a normal Survival Lobby at y coordinates 0-1. You can only move along this line, the edges are blocked by what may first feel likeInvisible Solidbut in fact isn't, asMobsandItemscan fall through it into the Void. You can't see around the edge even in third person camera.
Biomesare exactly the same as in normal Open World, Plains, Forests, Deserts, Mountains, etc. Getting a specific resource can be tedious because each Biome is only a few ten or hundred Blocks long and the naturally spawning resources appear very rarely. For example, Ores are much harder to find here as each vein is only 1 or 2 Blocks big.
PvP is enabled. Even though the spawn is protected, camping and killing is very easy as there is nowhere to run and hide. Building a base in this world doesn't make much sense. You can create aTribeand set Homes.
14 January, 2025: Added to Bloxd.io for a Limited Time.
18 February, 2025: Removed from the main menu.
20 March, 2025: Re-added as an option when creating custom Open-World lobbies andCustom Games.
The game mode's thumbnail is 2D.
You can fly around the edge in Creative mode (making it easier to build).
This is the only type of gamemode to limit one coordinate to a specific number.
It is unknown why the gamemode disappeared even though the battle between Defusal was not over. However, it is widely believed that it was removed because both gamemodes were terrible.
Moonstone is the hardest ore to get, as it only spawns at y=-85, and because it is one block wide, a strip mine doesn't uncover any blocks to the sides, making strip mining 33% as efficient.
Obtaining any type of Meat is almost impossible as Mobs if you're even lucky enough to find them; they will just run away from you and jump into the Void. This is partially fixed by theSmart Mobsupdate.
Your surroundings may not be Invisible Solid because you can still throw items outside of it, but for the player it is not possible to go out. Most likely, it works as a semi-solid block that only cares about some hitboxes.

--- Page 225: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Ores ---
AnOreis a piece ofStonecontaining minerals. Ores can be mined and smelted to obtain useful resources like (Diamonds,Gold,Iron,MoonstoneandCoal)  While the first Ores you find areCoalandIron. Once you go deeper than -75 on the y-axis, you will find most of the valuable ones (Diamond,Gold, &Moonstone). AnIron Pickaxeand higher tierPickaxescan mine all Ores, while lowerWoodandStone Pickaxesdon't drop all, so make sure to craft one before going down into the mines.

These Blocks look similar toStone, but with color patches representing the mineral inside. Every Ore texture is practically the same in the default texture pack, but with a different color of the patches (Black forCoal, Beige forIron, Yellow forGold, Cyan forDiamondsand Bluish White forMoonstone.)
An update replaced the droppings of Iron and Gold Ores intoRawIron and Gold.
Ores are sometimes used as decoration, but mostly they serve for obtaining valuable minerals.
You can see some (important/useful) crafts of the minerals in the picture below.Equipmentis made out the refined minerals that come from Ores.

Raw Ore is what drops from break iron or gold ore and can be smelted into the bar version of the Raw Ore with 1 raw iron or gold and 1 coal.
There are currently 2 Ores that cannot be obtained inSurvivaland are only obtainable throughPirates,Doodle Cube, Greenville and custom worlds
Emerald Ore(Doodle Cubeas a building Block option andGreenville)
Lapis Lazuli Ore(Pirates- in a cave on one of the maps (removed) andGreenville)
Around 07/11/2025, the developers slightly changed cave generation. At the same time, Diamond Ore generation was changed to generate starting from y = -85. This was first noticed by a texture pack creator (?) (5:04 PM PDT 7/13/2025). For the caves, untouched chunks would have the veins in caves slightly change, and Diamond Ores could now be found at the same level as Moonstone Ores.
Moonstone ores only generate at y = -85.
Coal can be obtained without having to go mining.

PaintballInfoDescriptionPaint the town red... or whatever colour you'd like!DeveloperSlushieScript Namepaintball
Paintballis a competitive mode wherein players strive to cover the terrain with their designated paint color utilizing Paintball Guns and Explosives. Each round is limited to a duration of three minutes; upon completion, the team that has achieved the highest percentage of the map painted is declared the winner.
Engage in the game by utilizing your Paintball Gun to color the landscape. Furthermore, players have the option to target opponents in order to eliminate them, thereby inhibiting their ability to paint. Explosives can be employed to cover extensive areas or to eliminate multiple players simultaneously. It is either 2 teams or 4 teams against each other.

21 November, 2024: Added toBloxd.io.
Home Turf (aka Team's Colour Speed): Speeds a player up when walking on their team's paint.
Enemy Turf (aka Opponent's Colour slowness): Slows a player down when walking on the opposing teams' paint.
The effect Icons are the same as for Speed and Slowness.
Kits have been added on December 2, 2024. They are divided into 2 categories: Firearms and Explosives. They can all be claimed for free; however, they must be equipped before the round starts.
Currently the game mode has 2 maps: Starter and Teams.
A list of possible team colors:
Red
Orange
Yellow
Green
Cyan
Blue
Purple
Magenta
Pink
In order to successfully win most all of the time, get a strategy:
Be on a team with a lot of players that are more skilled. This will go on different formations; 1 has to paint the area, 2 has to kill the player on the other team, and the rest can either protect their site or paint the site with their own color of course.
Firearms: Use bow. Using it will spread out the range for the balls AND there are 5 balls when released. So the center can go in the enemies’ side, while the rest of the 4 can paint other areas.
Explosives: Seeking. Upon contacting a player, it’ll immediately kill the player and explode out your paint color. This is useful when a player is going straight to your color team in a straight line. Using it and before the player can even react, the player will die. Quickly cover the paint so the enemy won’t have the turf.
The player in this mode's thumbnail is named FamousCentaur8516061. However, the account does not exist.
A few minutes after this game mode was added to Bloxd.io it became a Limited-Time Game.
In the thumbnail of this game mode, there is an empty block (Smooth Diorite), which means that block does not belong to any team's territory.
If a player has not chosen a team by the time the round starts, the player will be randomly assigned a non-full team.
Painting the walls of a map will still count towards the percentage of map covered.
The paintballs shot by the weapons look and work similarly to Pebbles.
This gamemode is inspired by Splatoon.

The originalgamemodeofBloxd.iowasBloxd Hop. This gamemode consists of Parkour in different maps.
Evil Toweris another originalgamemode, which is a Parkour without checkpoints. You need some more skills to do this. This is inspired by Roblox game "Tower of Hell".
Jumping is the main part of Parkour. Press [space] and [W] (or other keys) to jump in a direction. Press Shift while walking to Sprint. If you jump while sprinting, the jump will be much longer.
It is normally possible to jump up to 5 Blocks, however, with Bunny Hopping enabled, one can do a 6-block jump, and if they double or triple bunny hop, one can do a 7-block jump. In ann-block jump,nrefers to how many Blocks were skipped (so a 0-Block jump wouldn't require jumping at all)
N/A
In Neo jumps, you need to jump around a pillar or wall. Normally, without Bunny hopping, it is possible to do a 4 Neo jump. With Bunny hopping, you can do a 5,6 and 7-block neo (requires double or triple bunny hop) Ann-neo jump refers to how many Blocks you need to jump across horizontally, meaning a 0-neo jump would require no jumping at all.
Water jumps are jumps done with the help of interacting with Water.
It is possible to jump much higher by spam-pressing [space] in Water. Very useful for escapes.
After taking off from land, it is possible to jump once on Water, giving you the upwards momentum again without touching the ground.
By placing Water against a five-Block high wall (on the second Block), you can simply walk into the water and jump twice, now you jump five Blocks vertically!
This is widely used in escaping, since it’s hard to climb mountains, while Water is easy to place and pick.
Ice gives you a boost if you walk/sprint on it, so you will also have a boost when Jumping.
In certain game modes you can get additional boosts for jumping. Morehere.
A checkpoint is a saving point that you can respawn/ teleport back to if you fall off the Parkour course.
Beds can be used to set your spawn point, so after dying by falling into the Void, you will respawn on the Bed.
If a lobby did not disable homes, checkpoints can be set whenever and wherever, using the /sethomecommand, and be utilized by /home. This makes Bed-separated sections with multiple Parkour jumps much easier.
InGreenville, Yellow Wool is used for checkpoints.
InBloxdHop, Gold Blocks are used for checkpoints.
As in theDYKs, Bunny Hopping is done by sprint jumping right as you land. This means you must press [space] in the moment you touch the ground after jumping. Do not misunderstand the DYK as: jump in the direction "right" after you land.
You can do 6 Block jumps (recommended with bhop), 5 block neos, and 9 Block Ice jumps with bunny hopping.
This is done by jumping right as you land 2 or 3 times, you need to perform the "jump right as you land " tip 2 or 3 times in a row to jump with an even bigger speed boost. The triple Bunny Hop gives the maximum speed possible-the quadruple and all future Bunny Hops give the same amount of buff as the Triple Bunny Hop.
You can do 7 Block jumps, 10 Block Ice neos, and 6 Block neos with 2 or 3 bunny hops,
Bunny Hop counter is a small feature that displays your Bunny Hops. It tells you whether your Bunny Hop is a single, double or triple plus Bunny Hop. In addition, Bunny Hopping now emits particles. They only serve aesthetic purposes.
Climbing is somewhat a way to Parkour, can make the course more complex or easy.
Ladders are the most common way to perform climbing.
Ladders made out ofWoodand Vines are very common in Parkour maps. You will get the same climbing speed no matter any Wood type (all are the same, myth busted), though in a ladder crouch glitch some ladders give less jump than others.
Ladders made out ofIronare common in Parkour. You will get a faster climbing speed.
There are many additional jump boost you can get using ladder glitches. Morehere.
Ladder Launchingis an old glitch that most parkour servers use.
You can climb on Trapdoors, but you will get a relatively slow speed no matter what Wood the Trapdoor is made of.
Door jumps are really different and unique, while it is technically climbing, as you have "jumped" 2 Blocks upwards. When you encounter a Door, make sure it is "closed", jump, then flick the Door open in mid-air. You would find yourself "sliced" by the Door. Jump again to get to the top.
Block clutching is mainly used inBedwarsorSky Wars. It is done by placing aBlockon the opposing wall while jumping to catch yourself midair. You could see it as a creating a short "bridge" extending from the place you want to jump to. Mastering clutches does require some practice, though.
The easiest way to Block clutch, place one Block while in midair.
A harder way to Block clutch. Place 2 Blocks to jump even longer.
This was once regarded impossible. You have to butterfly/drag click to place 3 Blocks. What's funny is thatYouTubersuse this in their montages, although we have to admit that it is really cool to see.
Head-hitters need a Block above you touching your head (basically smashing your head against the ceiling in a 2-Block tall hole).
The easiest way to do a head-hitter, crouch on the side of the Block and jump and sprint. (can be done without sprinting)
You have to build a momentum by hitting your head a few times before jumping. It requires some practice. However, this jump can also be cheated by jumping around the gap if it all possible.'
These jumps are actually quite easy. To do it, crouch to the edge of the block and jump off while still crouching and sprint to the next block.
Long name, isn't it? It may seem scary, but it is actually easier and possible than a full head hitter neo. It is a staircase but with head hitters and you have to jump around a space technically less than a Block. To do this, crouch to the edge of a block, then jump and hold A, then get to the block you wanted to get to.
There are some parkouring methods that are intended to be glitched in someWorldslobbies.
By placing a Ladder in a protected chunk and climbing on before it disappears, you can actually climb up walls by spamming Ladders.
There is a glitch that uses the transparency glitch that sends you directly up to the Block above you when you rejoin the server. You can use this to your advantage in tower-courses.
You can jump even higher than one Block apart from using water.
With Splash Knockback Potions, you can jump higher without taking any damage. You can use multiple Knockback Potions to jump even higher or you can use a level II knockback potion. It is sometimes paired with speed potions.
You could fly really high when drinking Knockback Potions in a boat because of the knockback multiplier. It got patched and you now fly a normal height of around 30 blocks.
By throwing aFireballunder you, you can also jump really high. Please note that you will take damage or you can even kill yourself by accident. A rarer form of this jump uses the Moonstone Explosive, like a TNT jump.
This will not work withIceballs, as they give the effect Frozen, which hinders your movement.
SomeFoodsandPotionsgive effects that could help you with Parkour.
Splash Knockback Potions (As said in the previous part)
Speed Potions (Jump further)
Jump Potions/Watermelon slices (Jump higher)
Note that Speed and Jump Potions are usually combined, and really good inPvPtoo. Also, if you are in a team parkour (in some maps, some jumps require teammates hitting you for a boost), you could use Tipped Arrows to help teammates.
These are Parkour challenges made by players themselves, either masters find normal ones too easy, or they are just up to a harder challenge.
When they say a 180 or 360, it means you have to turn around midair by how many degrees while jumping. For example, you have to spin a circle midair while jumping to do a 360. The maximum number of Blocks you could jump while spinning is 3 (4 is theoretically possible with Bunny hopping, but REALLY hard).
With the Crouch Toggles setting, you can do crouch Parkour with up to 1.5 Blocks. This is extremely hard as you are very slow. The only strong thing with this feature is that it makes head-hitter staircase semi-neos easier.
Jumping backwards is also extremely hard as you cannot aim. The real challenge is doing a backwards Bunny-hop.

Similar toCustom Games, players can share their parkour maps by uploading a schematic to the website.
When it was first added to Staging.bloxd.io, it did not have any games on it and only showed the message: "No search results found".This is because players did not get the chance to upload any schematics to the website yet.
This is because players did not get the chance to upload any schematics to the website yet.
This game features the Player Crafted tag, meaning that it is focused on player-created content.

The gamemodes on Parkour Obby games get less players and likes then custom games.

To create your own Party, click on the Purple button on top of theHome Page. While in-game, you can find this button in theFriendsMenu on the right side of the page. When you create a Party, you will automatically join it and become the leader. Copy the Party Code and send it to other players.
When you receive a Party Code, paste it in and press "Join Party" button. In the Friends Menu you will now see which lobby the party is going on in. You can always leave a Party and Parties get deleted after the owner has been inactive for a while or has left the Party.
Parties were added on 25/10/2024 by the developerOliver. When Parties were added, they were connected to the friends screen. A few days later, it was moved to the center of the screen. When you wanted to join a Party or create one, you had to click on the yellow button. This was recently changed to a purple button.

This is a game for players to have fun with other players.Armoris still craftable but is only used for decoration and not for game progression. There is no health bar and there is no way to die in thisgamemodeeven if you fall into the Void.
It is possible to craft all Survival Items in Peaceful except forSwords. However,Bows,Explosives,Fireballsand similarItemsdon't deal damage to players, as there is no health bar in Peaceful. Swords are obtainable in PeacefulWorldslobbies with the use of press to getBoards. However, obtaining swords are now possible throughDraugr Knightmob farms.
Available utilities in Peaceful are:
Teleporting to lobby spawn
Requesting teleport to a player
Setting a home
Creating a Tribe (costs 2 Iron Bars)
You can craft an unlimited amount of Protectors and TribeProtectors. You can place a maximum of 8 Protectors and 4 Tribe Protectors at once. Protectors disappear if their owners don't join the lobby for more than 30 days.

The Pig was added on November 20, 2024, Pigs are one of the first mobs to be officially added and the developers did not say anything about pigs before their addition, unlike the Cows and Sheep which they introduced on the Bloxd server in the social networking site Discord. This mob usually spawns in forested biomes and grass biomes.
Pigs spawn in forests and grasslands. They drop out of the sky when they spawn and will despawn after a long period of time or when no players are nearby. The pigs will usually appear in herds of 4-6 and most of the time are not alone.
Also was added on the same day Pigs came to the game, Raw Porkchops used to be drop from pigs when they die; but when cows were added, the chance of a piece of Raw Porkchop to drop was decreased from 100% to 38.75% meaning that 2 in every 5 pigs are able to drop Raw Porkchops when killed. Raw Porkchops cannot be eaten and can only be cooked into Cooked Porkchops in a Furnace. To make a piece of Cooked Porkchop, 1 Coal and 1 Raw Porkchop is required.
This mob presumably has 75-76 hp, as it can withstand a 70-hp shot with an AWP and another punch, and as it would take nineteen punches, each dealing 4hp, before dying. A pig used to have lesser hp but after a few days the hp of pigs was increased. A pig can be two-shot by/with a Diamond Sword.
Added on November 25, 2024, this mob's Sound sounds like a "man's scream". Maybe the developers are testing.
After Pigs spawn they turn around up to ~160° and sprint 5 - 7 blocks straight. Afterwards the cycle continues.
At 16:51 on November 20, 2024 (London time zone, UTC+0), developer Dirty Flea Sack updated this sentence on the dev-log announcement channel, one of the two announcement channels of the Bloxd server on the social network Discord: "added pigs", the beginning of the pig mob in the game.
Spawn Orbs (for Pigs) were added on December 12, 2024 along with other spawn orbs for Cow mobs. This orb only appears in Creative, Worlds, and Plots gamemodes. Throw the orb and a pig will spawn. But you can't spawn multiple mobs in one place or spawn too many in a lobby.
You can use Raw Porkchop and Cooked Porkchop to tame theWolfandWildcat.
This mob movement has created problems as some mobs move underwater, down caves, etc.
During a time if a Pig touched a boat, the entire lobby would have crashed.
On November 20, 2024, a new mob, the pig, was added to all versions of bloxd (besides the archived ones).
On November 21, 2024, developers increased mob health, mob spawn rate, number of mobs in lobby, and made it so that mobs no longer spawn in caves.
On November 25, 2024, developers gave pigs the ability to move in herds, and made the number of pigs related to how many players are online (per lobby.)
This mob used to not take damage from spikes, moonstone explosives, and firearms.
Previously, this mob only had 40 hp.
Unlike Cows (before, now added) and Sheep which were introduced and will be added in the near future, Pigs were not introduced but are the first and official mobs added.
It is possible that a pig has 73-76 hit points instead because any entity with that amount of health points will also take 19 hits before dying.
They have a very simple pathfinding mechanic, making them walk around in straight lines occasionally and often falling into caves. They face a random direction and go a random amount of blocks toward that direction.
Some joke textures have been made about the pig.
You can't kill them with instant damage potions.
Pigs won't be affected by potions, even ones with a positive buff.
In Discord, JanuaryBoy posted an image of him testing out "Test Pigs."
Like other updates, when the developers added this mob to the game, the game broke.
Pigs used to be rare, now they are only used for slaughter as the developers (especially Dirty Flea Sack) increased the chances of finding pigs and traveling in a herd.

PiratesInfoDescriptionDestroy your enemy's ship to win!DeveloperDirty Flea SackScript Nameunknown

Piratesis a gamemode that was introduced on December 6, 2023. Its primary objective is to destroy the opposing team's spawn blocks, followed by eliminating all players from the enemy team(s). The game mode was removed just 16 hours after its debut, preventing most players from experiencing its initial version. However, it has since been reintroduced later onbloxd.ioas apermanentgamemode, because it won the vote againstSurvival Royale.
This gamemode was developed byDirtyFleaSack, a member of the Bloxd.io development team.

At the start of a match players will spawn in the pre-game lobby. You can choose a team by standing on a colored block of wool. If the block of wool is glass, then that means the team is full, which means you have to switch teams. The team options are:Red, Blue, Yellow[4 teams],and finallyGreen[4 teams].  There are maps with 2 teams (Red and Blue) and maps with 4 teams (Red, Blue, Yellow and Green). Each team has a base with spawn Blocks placed around it. Mostly the bases are ships, however the Blue team's base is an island in two maps, Scurvy Shores and Cutthroat cliffs [not really fair to the red team] Your goal is to get to the other team(s) base and destroy their Spawn Blocks. After that kill all the enemy players before they destroy your Spawns. The game ends when all teams but one are eliminated. Keep in mind that you only win if your team wins AND you are still alive when this happens. You don't have to have any Spawn Blocks left however. It’s actually possible to play a 1V1 game (1 player VS 1 player).
A cannon in game.
The pop up you see when you have the coward’s curse effect
Players can fire the cannons by clicking on thePatterned Glassmatching their team's color. By doing this, the cannon will launch aMoonstone Explosiveat the enemy ship [ if you have the kitcannoner, the cannon will firetwoexplosives at the enemy ship]. If a cannon is reloading, then the Patterned Glass turns into regular (not Patterned) colored Glass, and the players cannot fire it again until it is reloaded. A player cannot fire a cannon on the enemy's ship, and a player cannot break their team’s own cannons. Players can destroy enemy cannons by breaking the Patterned Glass, causing it to reload without firing aMoonstone Explosive. Players cannot destroy a reloading cannon. The cannon firing range for the Scurvy Shores and Cutthroat Cliffs blue side is very short, often causing little to no damage to the red ship. The cannons for Treasure Island and Classic (4 Teams) fire across the ocean to the opposite ship. ITS VERY RARE, but sometimes you can break a spawn block (If there are spawn blocks on the bottom of the ship).
A Spawn Block In Game
Spawn blocks are marked with Lime PatternedGlass. There are 5-10 Spawn Blocks aboard each ship or territory. If a player dies, they will respawn on one of the remaining Spawn Blocks. If a Spawn Block is destroyed while a player is respawning, the Spawn Block will turn into a Maple Wood Plank and the player will spawn on that instead. Note that players cannot respawn again on this "fake" Spawn Block. The main goal of the game is to destroy all spawn blocks on the enemy's ship so they cannot respawn. A player cannot destroy their own Spawn Blocks, nor can they cover up the Spawn Blocks withBlocks. Axes break Spawn Blocks faster.
If you go too far on maps or go too high, you will get the effect Coward's Curse. You will get an effect of Poison II. This is used to prevent hiders and tower players. Try to use a Splash Knockback Potion instead of aFireballto propel yourself. You may get poisoned as Fireballs launch you much higher (or just use kits that help with jumps or traveling). When you get coward’s curse, there will be a pop up saying “ 💀 Return to the fight or perish, coward.…💀”
Coins and Gems are used to buy Mystery Kits and Kits. You get 5 Coins per Spawn broken or per final kill, and 25 coins for winning. Now you also get 1 Coin for saying GG or gg after a match. Gems are obtained when the Mystery Kit attempts to give you a kit you already have. The gems you get are based on how rare the kit that you tried to get was.
If your team wins a game, there will be a pop up saying (team) WINS! You get 25 gold!! (example: RED TEAM WINS!!! You get 25 gold!)
If you win a match and say “gg” (which means “good game”) in thechat, there will be writing in green text saying “+1 coin for saying GG!”, which means the player get one coin for being nice.
Classic by tomonmars-mcMap Link:https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Map:Spawn_Blocks_Locations_Twin_Ships_-_by_tomonmars_mcA big clash between two pirate armies! Red versus Blue, swashbuckle through this classic map to victory! You have the same spawn location mirrored in both ships. Each ship on this map haseightSpawn Blocks. This is the fastest-paced map because the ships are near to each other and relatively small. A game often lasts less than 3 minutes.
The best way to approach another ship is either bridging from the cannons on the main deck, or to climb the masts and fireball your way to the other ship. Make sure you don't jump when fireballing, or else you'll fail the jump. Keep an eye on your height! You will be poisoned if you go too high, as this is the map with the lowest poison height!
Recommended Kits
Bomber (Rush!)
Pegleg (bridge fights)
Captain (completely destroy the enemy team with your allies!)
Spawn blocks for Classic Map

Map Trivia
These have been slightly patched, due to Stone Pickaxe being removed from the starting inventory, you will have to use the Messy Stone on the anchor to make a Stone Pickaxe, but then there wouldn't be enough Messy Stone for an Artisan Bench, seeing that there are only 3 Messy Stone Blocks. You will need Engineer kit to get Iron now.It is possible to get Iron with Engineer kit. Find the anchor on the ship which is somewhere near the bow. Mine twoMessy Stone. Then mine the Iron. Use the Messy Stone and your Wood to make an Artisan Bench, then degrade all the Iron Blocks with it. Use the Iron obtained to craft Tools, Armor, etc. Leaving the Wood Boots could be a smart idea, though. This will let your teammates not to be confused. (Patched - you now cannot take off your original armor)Following the iron feature, crafting a Bucket could sometimes be a good idea. You can scare enemies if you place down water. Some professionals in the game mode, especially, get scared because they are used to not touching water. (Also patched - you now cannot pick up water with Buckets)It's also a good idea to craft an Iron Axe to speedrun spawns.

It's also a good idea to craft an Iron Axe to speedrun spawns.
Below the ship is a floor of Water on top of Aspen Wood Planks, where you will die if stepped on.
There is a Block of Mega Compressed Messy Stone in one of the cabins.
There is a Board that states the map creator on Instagram. The map designer is named "tomonmars_mc".
In old Pirates, there were only 7 Spawn Blocks (the new version added a Spawn Block in the Captain's Room.)
In old Pirates when you could cover up Spawn Blocks, some people used the Iron on the anchor to protect it.
Scurvy Shores by unknown
A big ship going against a small village!! Who will win? Bridge over the wide seas and raid this village, pirates, or defend your home and fight back! This village has many houses, and even has a death zone if you go to far. Don't wander around and forget your team! There areTENSpawn Blocks in this map for each side.
Recommended Kits
Engineer (Build an impenetrable fort! You are safe to build it on a Spawn Block.)
Navigator (Spawn Blocks are quite hard to find because of the huge map size)
Captain (Quickly rush their Spawns!)
Raven (You can quickly climb up structures since there are towers.)
Cannoneer (You can instantly break the ship's Spawn Blocks if used correctly.) (Only good if you are in the Blue team.)
Village Spawn Blocks

Ship Spawn Blocks

Map Trivia
If you go and dig down near the back right of the village, you can find a hidden room that looks like half of a ship's hull.
This map, along with Cuttthroat Cliffs, is slightly unfair towards the Red team
Cutthroat Cliffs by Dirty Flea Sack
A Giant Mountain going against a colossal ship? Sounds fun, but are you up for the challenge? Raid the mountainous village with 2 different levels to it or go against the red pirates and discover Spawn Blocks in their barracks! There areTENSpawn Blocks in this map for each side.
Recommended Kits
Swashbuckler (climb around the Trees or the ship's sail!) or (tower up and place ladders for your team to go up easily!)
Pegleg (There are mostly bridging going on in this map. So you can knock down enemies.)
Captain (Time to rush 'em off!)
Bomber (Most of the Spawn Blocks are close up together. So you can destroy them easily.) (Only if you are in the Red team.)
Portalmaster (Since the map is pretty big. You can use Portals to teleport.)
Firebreather (the blue team usually starts to bridge immediately at the start. Just use your fireballs to hit them).
Mountain Village Spawn Blocks

Big Red Ship Spawn Blocks

Map Trivia
There is a mineshaft inside of the mountain, you can access it and get special ores inside!
There is also a big room with Orange and Purple colored Wool and Obsidian inside the mountain. You may have to use x-ray to find it.
This map, along with Scurvy Shores, is slightly unfair towards the Red team
4 ships battling for an island full of treasures! There are 4 teams (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green), with 5 players in each team at max and 5 spawns on each ship. There are 13 Loot Chests on the island, and can contain the following items: Apple, Pear, Cracked Coconut, Pumpkin Pie, Gold Melon Slice, Defense Potion, Fireball, Moonstone Explosive, Moonstone Orb, Gold Axe.
Recommended kits
Juggernaut (demolish the other teams!)
Swashbuckler (Considered great for PvP since a lot of people will be trying to hunt for loot)
Pegleg (knock other players into the water!)
Captain (rush to mid for op loot!)
Raven (the loot in mid perfectly supports and destabilizes your weaknesses!)
Ghost (quickly toss a Haunting Orb to the ships next to you! It is close and will likely land!)
Keeper(anything you grab from the middle is your forever, until you use it or get eliminated)
Ship Spawn Blocks/chests for booty

Map Trivia
One of the spawn glitches' spawns are here: the one in the captain's room in Green team.
This map has the highest Coward's Curse inflicting height.
Is the OG map not giving you enough hype? No worries, here is another Classic, but with 4 teams of 5 (Red, Yellow, Blue, Green)! There is also a giant arena with complex ring designs ofMaple Wood Planksin the middle of the map, be sure not to fall off and fight off your enemies! The easiest way to rush is to go up to a cannon, fireball jump, use Scout's double-jump, and go to the ring. Then, fireball-double jump again to another ship, and try to jump onto the deck, or use double-jump to clutch on the ladders.
Recommended kits
Raven (the complex design of the sails makes it perfect to hide)
Captain (Awesome for long term fights)
Scout (Even though it has weakness. It is still good for classic since you can easily break Spawns)
Ship Spawn Blocks
(add pic here)
Map Trivia
This is the first ever map name in all modes with brackets.

2 ships for each team having war at sea! Having 7 spawn blocks for each team, the width of the map is expanded. The lower deck of the ship do not provide cannons.
Pegleg: most people tend to bridge, knock them off in bridge fights!
Hawk: quickly glide over to the faraway enemy ships.
Cannoneer: Good for breaking spawn blocks (if used correctly, 4 spawn blocks can be destroyed).

Kits are a very important part of Pirates. For more information, check out this pagehere.
Check the Blog here.
Perks were added on the 13th of August 2024. They are similar to Perks inSkywars. Below is a list of Perks:
All Perks cost 30 Gems for the first level. The price is doubled for the next level, doubled again for level 3 and so on. It's not yet known where the limit for Perks is. Probably the chances can't be increased over 100%, but anyway players would need absurd amounts of Gems/Coins to be able to buy 10 levels of one Perk.
Before, breaking an enemy cannon would drop the Patterned Glass at the end of that cannon. This means that you can technically relocate the cannons to a completely different location. This is now patched with the removal of the feature, making the cannons unable to fire instead.Note that this could bring an advantage to the enemy, as the new location of the cannon may be beneficial for them.
In old Pirates, breaking a Spawn Block could drop a fake Spawn Block. You can place it somewhere else, but people can't spawn on it.
In old Pirates, Spawn Blocks acted like normalGlass. The break time was shorter, and you could break them with Fireballs.This was too OP though and got removed.
In old Pirates, you will die even as a spectator if you touch the death height. (Water) This was removed byDirty Flea Sackdue to many players complaining about it.
There was a glitch where if your team loses all Spawn Blocks while you are respawning, you are recorded as "dead" and when you respawn, you are in spectator. It was fixed byDirty Flea Sack, though later causing an infinite respawn glitch in some maps (Green in Treasure Island and Red in Cutthroat Cliffs)
The Captain used to have a speed boost instead of damage reduction boost, making it quite OP and hard to deal with.
Scout used to have an Iron Sword and no Weakness 10 (now it does).
The KitPortalmasterused to not have Moonstone Explosives until recently.
You used to be able to drop your armour and give it to someone else. This allows you to switch armour with a member of the opposing team which makes it look like you are in the other team. This has been fixed.
If you enter "gg" after a round, you will get 1coin. This also works inInfectionandSky Wars.

--- Page 235: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Pirates/Kits ---
Kits are a very important part of Pirates.
By buying a mystery box in the shop for 100 Coins, you would get a random Kit. If you have already owned that Kit, you will get some Gems instead.
Items will be replenished if you die or if you use up all of them. The Items replenish after 5 to 15 seconds. Note that if you die, your whole inventory is reset to the starting inventory of your Kit. This means that any items that were not in the original kit will be lost.Compasseswill be kept. Some Kits have special Items or effects. Scroll down to 'Special Items and Effects' or clickherefor more information. Also, you may find some of our fellow editors' notes here to show the real reflection of players, as we do play Pirates a lot!
Note: Unless specified, all items are singular (so Iron Sword means one Iron Sword)

It wasSERIOUSLYnerfed, though. It has a stone Sword which hinders its attacking potential, weakness X (ten), which makes it vulnerable to almost every Kit. It can only survive 2 Fireball jumps and a close contact with an Explosive kills you. Although being pretty weak, it still finds use in rushing.

Firebreather is also used for knocking off opponents whilst bridging as it deals the same effect as the knock back potion but it is slower than the Bow. The Firebreathers Resistance let’s you heal yourself after you launch yourself with a Fireball, the healing is more frequent than normal and heals 7 instead of 5.

Haunting Orb (Get "Haunting..." effect for 15 seconds after thrown, works as aMoonstone Orb. Player will be teleported back to where you've thrown the orb after effect running out. During this period, you will have Iron Chestplate & Leggings. While the orb lands, you'll get invisibilty and health regeneration for a few seconds.)
50 Maple Wood Planks
10 Arrow
Also, due to the additional Armor to the haunting, this can be used in combat.
Unfortunately, you don't have Fireballs or Explosive, making this a pretty bad Kit in most situations. However, if you play with this Kit in Treasure Island, it can be good, because you get Explosives and Fireballs from the Chests.
Also, due to how hard Moonstone Orbs are to aim, this Kit still stinks anyway.

This kit is really good for breaking Spawns out in the open and scaring enemies away. Due to Moonstone Explosives not being part of the starting Inventory, however, you may have to resort to an Axe.

No one uses your Portals.
If your team knows what you are actually doing, you need to lead the entire team as  portals can destroy teams one by one. (Reminder: some “Newbie”  in Pirates may break their team’s own portal and making Portalmasters fuming) You are able to escape from players by placing a Portal while getting chased to make players not able tocatch up to you. Just remember you must have one Portal Block placed already!

However, going full sweat makes this Kit really good. Your only weakness is close range. You could easily dodge snipes with your triple jump, and bomb your enemies with your Potions, although the radius is smaller than usual.
actually, i love its mobility so much i named my charachter after it, bird, it is good at ambush and spawn farming, once they pull out their swodds tho, RUN

The worst part is the fact you can become visible with pretty much everything you do; placing and breaking Blocks, throwing Fireballs, placing Explosive, sniping  and attacking will all make you visible. The only thing you can do without revealing yourself is move. The fact that you reveal yourself when attacking makes the description VERY misleading. You also get an attack buff for a few seconds after the invisibility wears off. You also will instantly die while shooting a Fireball at yourself while you are invisible. You also cannot break Spawns while you are invisible.

PlantsareBlocksthat live and grow and inhabit theBloxd.ioworld. Some plants require a Seed or Sapling to grow. These Plants are farmable, meaning you can grow an indefinite amount of them. Other Plants can only spawn by themselves when the world is generated (Open Worlds) or be found in certain other game modes. They are farmable by placing them on farmland, causing them to grow/multiply.

Flowers can be used to change the color of someBlocksorItems. This process is used for decoration. Some Flowers must be used together to dye something a specific color.
Flowers can be farmed by placing them on Tilled Soil. Flowers placed on Tilled Soil will spread to other Tilled Soil around them.
BlocksorItemsthat can be dyed:
WoodPlanks
Concrete
Wool
Glassand all its variations, including Colored and Patterned Glass,
Baked Clay

To color or dye anItemuses aFloweron a artisan bench. Below is a list ofFlowersthat can dye things. All recipes are used in theArtisan Bench. Please note that a Cactus can replace Grass in any of the recipes. Poppy can replace Red Tulip and vice versa.
Seedsare used for farming and can offer an abundance ofFood. Below is a list ofBlocksandItemsthat the Seeds grow into:
Moonstone Pickaxe
Moonstone Pickaxe
Moonstone Pickaxe
Red Chili Pepper Plants will grow if placed near Lava. They grow slightly faster and yield 2 Chili Peppers when right-clicked.
Grass and Tall Grassare common Plants that can be found in mostBiomesbut mainly Plains and Grassy Plains Biomes. They can be used as a dye and are obtained usingShears. When Grass or Tall Grass is mined, it will either drop the Item (if you are using Shears) or it will drop nothing  (if you're using anything that aren't Shears). There is a chance it will drop Wheat Seeds when mined. (Tall Grass will drop two Wheat seeds instead of one) Grass and Tall Grass are the only Blocks that will not drop themselves if mined with aMoonstone Pickaxe.
Leavesare found on top of theTree, serving the decorative purpose. Leaves have crafting recipes of their own. When you mine tree-grown Leaves, it will always drop a Leaves Block. In addition there is a chance of it dropping a Sapling respective to the Tree type or the Fruit respective to the Tree type. Player-placed Leaves will always drop themselves. SeeFoodpage for more information about Fruits.
Oops i broke it i don't know how to make tables :(

When a tree grown leaf is broken there is a chance it will drop fruit or a sapling, Below is a table showing the approximate chances. (Due to not being able to see the true chances this is a approximate tested by breaking 3k+ tree grown leaves and getting the rates)
Saplings are plants used for growingTrees, there are ten types of Saplings currently. Note that a Sapling automatically re-plants after the bottom Block of a Tree is broken.
Vines are Plants which are used for climbing and are found in forestBiomesonTrees. They can grow upwards if there is a Block behind and nothing above and are highly useful as they are easier to obtain than Ladders. Often used for decoration.
Cactus are plants found in DesertBiomes. When Cacti or Fat Cacti is Placed onSand, It grows up to three Blocks tall, while placing Cacti or Fat Cacti onRed Sandmakes it grow up to four Blocks.
If you right-click a Fat Cactus with a Bucket or a Glass Bottle, the Bucket/Bottle will fill with Water. If you right-click a Fat Cactus with aBucket, it turns into a Dry Fat Cactus. Dry Fat Cacti will turn back into Fat Cactus when placed on any surface after a short period of time. Cactus can be used for brewingPotionslike the Instant Damage and Poison Potions. You can also use Cactus (not Fat Cactus) as a replacement for Grass and Tall Grass when dyeing.
Fat Cactus can also be used as a weapon since it can deal 22 damage (27 dmg for critical hits) and Dry Fat Cactus deals 27 dmg (33 dmg for critical hits)
Mushrooms are found in Forest Biomes and can be crafted into MushroomBlocksand Mushroom Soup. Mushrooms can be farmed by placing them on Tilled Soil, Mushrooms placed on Tilled Soil will spread to other Tilled Soil around them. Fat Mushrooms can be found in Forest Biomes or crafted from four normal Mushrooms. They are solid Blocks and make the player bounce up and down if touching them. Falling on Fat Mushroom from any height doesn't deal any fall damage. They are equivalent to Minecraft's Slime Blocks.
Bluebellsspawn in multitudes inBluebell Forests. However, it is different from other Flowers because it is only found inBluebell Forest.
WhenFlowersor Mushrooms are placed on Tilled Soil, they are multiplied.
Azure Bluet and Lily of The Valley areillegalFlowers.
If you harvest Melons and Watermelons with aMoonstone Pickaxe, they drop their respective Blocks instead ofMelon and Watermelon Slices. Although it costs rare materials, the trade-off is that the inventory is not cramped.
Red Mushrooms spread to other Tilled Soil around them slower than Brown Mushrooms do.
Most plants are transparent Blocks and do not work with texture packs.
If you stand directly in the middle of plants such asFlowers, Saplings, Grass or Mushrooms, etc you will not be able to see the plant.
When Cacti or Fat Cacti is Placed onRed Sand, it grows up to four Blocks tall.
You cannot collect Red Mushroom and Brown Mushroom inGreenville, but you can collect them through abuginGreenvilleon August 4, 2024, however, it has been fixed.
You can remove Grass and Tall Grass by placing a block on it. It is unclear if this is a bug or not.
Wither Rose was replaced by Shadow Rose in the Frozen Badlands update on May 2, 2025.

A Player Name Tagis the name of aPlayeryou see in game.

A Player Name Tag isNOTaName Tag. It displays your name in other Players’ perspective and yours (in3rd person). It floats slightly above a Player's head and is always turned towards the viewer. For more info about the names of Players, checkMain Menu.
Sometime in March 2024, Bloxd moderators added a feature that you can see Name Tags through Blocks and changed the Player Name Tag to be black with white font, while previously they were black font on white background. Name Tags aren't visible:
While crouching
InMurder Mystery
InHide and Seekif you are a hidden Hider
All these exceptions are there to allow players to hide in some way.
On the 28th of February 2025,Potioneffects icons have been added to Player Name Tags. Whenever a player receives one or more Potion effects, the icons for these effects will be displayed on the player's name tag. This allows you to choose between attacking players with bad effects like Weakness or Slowness and running from players with good effects like Defense or Strength.
In addition, you can now see a Player's Health Bar under his Name Tag for a short time after he's damaged. This helps you predict whether it's safe to continue attacking or should you back up. The Health Bar is colored green when near-full and turns yellow, orange and red the less health the Player has.
Roles have also been added to Player Name Tags. CheckSuper RankandBedwarsfor more info.
Some other Entities also have Name Tags that look just like Player Name Tags. These Entities are Shop and Upgrades inBedwarsand other PvP modes, Sites and Spike Bombs inDefusal, etc. ( there is a photo in the update log of mobs with name tags )
When you enter a tribe or a faction, the members of the tribe who are online will appear in the direction they are standing and look the way you look. Next to it is the number of meters (1 block equals 1 meter, meaning the number of meters equals the number of Blocks apart) away from you, for example, player A sees player B standing 12345 meters away from him, meaning player B is standing 12345 Blocks away from player A. As for yourself, a few days after being added, if you are standing 0 meters away from yourself (it could be an error or not updated yet or other reasons), now you can only see the name. The background color of the name tag is green.
Your Player Name Tag will change if you change your name in theMain Menu. However, after changing once, you have to wait another 2 hours to change again.

If you play Minecraft, you should keep in mind that the combat in Bloxd is a bit like 1.8, or Bedrock edition PvP.
Use LMB and aim your crosshair at your enemies to hit them! Click faster to deal more damage, do note that even if you click really fast, your hits only register once per 0.4 seconds. (So about 2.5 hits a second maximum)
There are lots of items that can help you PvP, even though not all would help, but knowing them helps you fight enemies if they use that item.
Iceball: 1 Moonstone + 1 Ice
Both are crafted in Workbench.
Well, after seeing all of the above, you probably still don't really get how to fight. Here are the basics and some slightly advanced tips to get better at PvP. If you are being hunted down without a sufficient weapon,fat cactuscan be used. It can deal 22 damage on a player with no armour. Dry fat cactus can deal 26-28
CPS, or Clicks Per Second is important; the more hits you get in, the more damage you deal. A really fun way to practice is by playing clicker games, such as cookie clicker. Clicks per second is important on how your fingers are positioned. Make sure your fingers are stretched over your mouse.
Practice your CPS athttps://cpstest.org/or other sites.
Though, sometimes higher cps doesn't work as there is cooldown in some items.
Also, please do watch out not to use drag click or other high cps clicking methods (this even counts if you doing by your hand) . Doing that will give you over 20 cps and the game will ban you if you have too high of a CPS because Bloxd.io thinks you are using autoclicker as cheating is not allowed.
Timing Hit
Even more important than CPS alone is timing your hits correctly. In Bloxd.io, damage is only registered every 0.4 seconds. So spamming 30 CPS won’t actually land more hits.That’s why the ideal CPS is around 12–16, or up to 20 if you can maintain control. But even a well-timed 2.5 CPS can deal similar damageifyour hits are timed perfectly. PvP isnt just about CPS, it’s about landing hits when they count.
Bloxd PvP isn't just about swining your weapon, it's about movement, aim, and later on, your ability to adapt to your opponents fighting style.
The foundation of pvp is movement: . Use "A" and "D" to strafe from side to side and make it harder for your opponent to hit you, and use "W" or "S" to move closer or further from your opponent. Avoid running straight toward them or backing up in a straight line, as it makes you easier to hit.  Also try to move in a circular formation when attacking. Aiming is also very important, keep your crosshair on your opponents to make sure your hits land. Don't just click as fast as you can, control where your crosshair is so your hits deal the most damage. If you are moving to the right, move your camera to the left, If you are moving to the left, move your camera to the right to keep your crosshair on your opponent.
Once you've mastered these basics, you'll be able to move on to more advanced tactics, but getting these right will already give you a strong advantage.
Keeping on hitting enemies are also important. Try to move forward if they got knocked back while quickly clicking. Do not let them touch you again. If the combo breaks, instants alter between left and right, keep clicking and you could still build combos again.
When you hit someone in midair, you deal 30% more damage, or 1.3x. This used to be 1.2x until it was buffed. This is a Critical Hit, or Crits. Crits are nice-to-have and could help you deal more damage.
Trees can also be used to escape and spam crits withHead-Hitter jumps.
Your first hit while sprinting deals extra knockback, so stopping your sprint while doing combos can help you hold a longer combo.
If you are in a fight, keep you eyes peeled on your health bar for heals or boosts. You may get killed without noticing if you don't, so keep that in mind.
This is generally different from other PVP mode as you don't keep your inventory, and for new players in a lobby, losing everything is a big discouragement. You can practice pvp with your friend or in gamemodes designed for PVPing.
This is surprisingly one of the most important factor to consider. All diamond armor let you survive a whole FIVE times longer, so you should always make sure you have sufficient armor in fighting, especially in gamemodes where your inventory are not kept like survival or faction. Try to get decent armor before challenging someone.
This is also extremely important in PVP, and these are the key food item you need to know about: a damage II potion more than doubles your damage output, and you can one shot a slightly armored player with a diamond bow under the effect. a defense II potion lets you survive twice longer (a total of ten times longer if you have diamond armor.) a speed II potion lets you run twice as fast, a jump II potion lets you jump 7 blocks high (basically a basic fireball jump everytime) a shield II potion let you survive 1.5 times longer, a splash instant heal II heals 60 health, a splash knockback  II potion takes you over 48 blocks high into the air if used right (throw it right under you to be lauchned high).

The map is separated into grids of 91 x 91 by roads made of Smooth StoneSlabsas the curb, GrayConcrete, and Ice for faster travel. 
Each 91 x 91 grid is composed of:
One layer ofGrass Blocksat y = 1
Infinite layers of Stone below the whole map
No height limits for buildings.
When you walk into another player's plot, the owner of the build is revealed, even if the player is not currently online in the lobby.

You will never find the bottom of the Stone layers, since they are generated every time you enter a deeper chunk, meaning the layers of Stone are endless.
Plots is like a version of limited Superflat inMinecraft.
Yourinventorywill reset everytime you exit the lobby, meaning the items in your inventory will disappear.
If you create new buildings and exit the lobby when those buildings are empty, when you re-enter, those buildings will disappear.
Plots changed their thumbnail on July 19, 2024.Bedwarsalso changed its thumbnail on the same day.
The builds in the Plots thumbnail are screenshots from Plots lobby 1 near plot 1 0.
Everytime you join a lobby, you  go to different coords,
Your builds are only presented on the lobby you started building on, but other lobbies get you a new empty plot which lets you can build up to trillions of different builds in different lobbies,

3.1Free Editing Glitch
If you threw a Splash Instant Healing or RegenerationPotionat another player, they would switch into Survival mode and couldn't go back into Creative mode unless the player left the lobby. However, the player would still be able to fly. Another player (most likely the one who threw the potion) can then kill them using projectile weapons (e.g., Fireballs). For this glitch to affect yourself, drink a Regeneration Potion.
Before being patched, on two sides of a player's Plot, they can break the curb (edge) of the road and the Blocks below it, making the plot 92*92 instead of the regular 91*91 size.
Attempting to teleport to a plot with 2 negative coordinates ( e.g -10 -23 ) doesn't work due to a bug.
If a player leaves the lobby, other players can then edit the plot, even if it wasn't theirs'.

PotionsInformationDescriptionAll types of PotionsMaximum Stack1

Potionsare drinks designed to give entities effects. They are created by brewing using aPotion Tableor milking a cow (for a milk potion), and when drunk, they give the player an effect for a limited time. All Potions are brewed from aWater Bottle, a Potion that gives the effect Hydration when drunk, though it serves no use. All Potions have two levels of power (I and II) except the Milk Potion (which removes all effects), the Heat Resistance Potion (which provides complete immunity to lava), and the Invisibility Potion (which makes the player invisible).
There are two types of potions: Splash potions (which you can throw) and Regular potions.

Protectors, also known as "chunk protectors" or "prots", serve as a safeguard for chunks, restricting editing access to the owner and authorized individuals. However, there are certain placement restrictions: they cannot be positioned within 192 blocks of the spawn point (or 6 chunks away) in OpenWorlds. Additionally, placement is prohibited if a protected chunk is already present directly above or below the intended location. Each Protector has a coverage area of 32x × 96y × 32zBlocks, effectively protecting a total of 3 chunks: the chunk it occupies, as well as the ones immediately above and below it.
Protectors, regardless of their type, serve a universal purpose: to safeguard builds andChestsfrom unauthorized access, thereby preventing raids and griefing. This protection applies to all game modes, with the exception ofFactions, where excessive Faction Protectors can compromise security. If a Protector is broken, the item can be retrieved from a distance. Alternatively, a Protector can be destroyed using one's fist, although this method yields no dropped items. Notably, Protectors do not function as intended inPlots, where they instead behave like regular buildingBlocks, offering no protective benefits.

Protectors let people place Books intoMailboxes, but not vice versa.
The Protector's appearance is characterized by a gray exterior, adorned with a cyan aura at its center, and intricate engravings that surround it. A prominent blue dot is also visible, symbolizing theDiamondsrequired for its crafting. Its design has undergone a revision, having previously resembledDiamond Orewithout shadows, until a update in late 2022 introduced its current aesthetic.
In Creative you can unlock Protectors by breaking/placing Blocks.
InPlotsyou can get unlimited Protectors but they don't protect chunks. They serve for decoration only. You can place them next to each other freely.
It used to be possible to get Protectors inGreenvillewith aglitch. They have been duped and can be found in abundance. They don't protect areas but work just like they do inPlots.
InDoodle Cubeyou now have creative so you can place protectors. They won't protect chunks though.
You used to be able to get infinite protectors by going to the recipe and shift clicking craft (you would need lots of diamonds to get more). This glitch has been fixed
If you want to work with your friend in a build but you put Protectors at the place where you build, you can allow them to edit your Protected area and build together.WARNING!The players you gave edit to will still have it if you leave the lobby. Don’t trust anyone. You may lose lots of materials! People often grief other's bases or steal Items. You can also remove edit from players.
Protectors you placed will disappear if you are absent from the lobby for more than 30 days, 23 hours and 59 minutes. This means everyone will be able to break Blocks in the previously protected areas!
Arthur added this feature so players who stopped playing don't take up space in different lobbies. Another reasons is this makes it possible to remove against-the-rules builds.

It is similar and works like a Protector, but all members of theTribecan use and edit it. It can be obtained if you are the Tribe leader, by pressing B on PC or the shopping trolley symbol at the bottom left corner on mobile. Then, press Manage Tribe, and you can buy Tribe Protectors in that menu for 2Moonstoneand 1Stoneof any kind. If you delete a Tribe, any Tribe Protectors you have placed will disappear.
Faction ProtectorInformationMaximum Stack999Best Tool to MinePickaxe
A Faction Protector was similar and worked like a regular Tribe Protector, but all members of aFactioncould use and edit it. It existed only inFactions. It could not be crafted, only obtainable inFactionsfor 100Gold Coins, assuming you were theFactionOwner. The maximum number of Faction Protectors a Faction could have depended on the amount of power it had. If Factions lost power, they could have more Faction Protectors than were allowed by their power. This could make a Faction Vulnerable, allowing others to raid them and break one of their Faction Protectors by pressing F in one of theFaction's protected chunk. This was the only way to break other Faction Protectors.
Placing Protectors is a complicated process, especially if you want to protect a certain area.
One Protector protects an area of three chunks in a vertical direction. No matter where in a chunk you place the Protector, it will always protect this chunk, the one above it and the one below it. It is important to understand that the Protector DOESN'T protect the 32×96×32 area around it, but three chunks, which are each 32×32×32 Blocks big and their borders were set when the world generated. You can place the Protector on the very edge of a chunk or in the middle and the protected area will still be the same.
You can place a Protector in every chunk of the horizontal plane. You can't however, place Protectors in every chunk vertically. If you want to protect a tower stretching over more than 3 chunks in the vertical direction, you must place a Protector in every third chunk. The game won't allow you to place the Protectors in the two chunks above or below the already protected chunk, even though only 3 chunks are protected.
The best things you can do to help yourself with placing Protectors are:
Turn on Chunk Coordinates in the Options ( press [O] ).
There are small messages that pop up, informing you you are exiting/entering you protected chunk. These have their complicated features too though, so don't rely just on them.
Try it out. Ask someone you trust to try breaking Blocks in the area you want to protect. You will see if everything is protected. If it's not, try experimenting a bit or ask someone trustworthy to find the right places you should place the protectors in.
If you have a protector and some chunks that you want to protect aren't protected and you just cannot place it, here's a simpler way: Go to the part that's unprotected, build up at least 40 blocks above, then place a protector.
There is a command /protectors that tells you where your Protectors are. Type it into chat. You will get a list of your placed Protectors and their coordinates. In Creative, you will also get info about how many Protectors you have unlocked.
At some point in March,Arthuradded the Tribe Protector for Tribes (factions) so players can easily have access to the tribe owner’s farm, storage, etc... But when adding that,Arthuraccidentally reset or deleted all of the Protectors. Many bases got looted, grieved, and even protected by other players. This makes a lot of players angry because they lost tons ofItemsor progress because of that. So,Arthur“refunded” them in the form of protectors,Blocks of Moonstone, andBlocks of Diamonddepending on how long the player has been playing on the server.4 protectors touching each other
4 protectors touching each other
Protectors are gray with a cyan aura—representing theDiamondsused in crafting them—in the middle and engravings surrounding it. But before late 2022, they used to look like aDiamondOre without the shadow, and no texturing or disorientation.
You can place 4 Protectors next to each other by placing them in the chunk borders of four chunks, and you cannot go further since protectors protect 32x96x32 area.
Protectors used to be limited by crafting. This means you could only craft 8 Protectors and their price also increased with each new Protector you crafted. You could only craft a new Protector if you lost one of the old ones. Later, Arthur changed it so you can now craft unlimited Protectors all for the same price. You can still only have 8 placed Protectors at once however.
Protector cannot be collected inGreenville, it is only a decorativeblock.
The red and yellow texture of this type of protector only shows if you are using the default texture pack. Otherwise, it looks the same as a Tribe Protector. At least it used to though, as one texture pack creator, L16_F51620, went and tried to modify the protector textures. The last texture of the texture pack used to be a faction protector at the time, so L16 went and figured out how to add them. Also, the developers forgot to actually update the default texture pack link, which is why he told everyone how to add faction protector textures.

Gold Melon Slices are eaten to make the player invisible for 18 Seconds
An Iron Watermelon
TheIron Watermelonhas an extremely small chance of spawning instead of a Watermelon when it grows, and can be crafted into 128 Iron Bars.
We still don't know the chance for an Iron Watermelon to grow, but it is speculated to be about 1 in 10000 chance of a Watermelon to spawn as an Iron Watermelon.
The Iron Watermelon is supposedly the first mob to be added as it would jumpscare you if you were to far away from it, but this feature was removed, and the Iron Watermelon Block still remains in the game.

If you play Minecraft, you should keep in mind that the combat in Bloxd is a bit like 1.8, or Bedrock edition PvP.
Use LMB and aim your crosshair at your enemies to hit them! Click faster to deal more damage, do note that even if you click really fast, your hits only register once per 0.4 seconds. (So about 2.5 hits a second maximum)
There are lots of items that can help you PvP, even though not all would help, but knowing them helps you fight enemies if they use that item.
Iceball: 1 Moonstone + 1 Ice
Both are crafted in Workbench.
Well, after seeing all of the above, you probably still don't really get how to fight. Here are the basics and some slightly advanced tips to get better at PvP. If you are being hunted down without a sufficient weapon,fat cactuscan be used. It can deal 22 damage on a player with no armour. Dry fat cactus can deal 26-28
CPS, or Clicks Per Second is important; the more hits you get in, the more damage you deal. A really fun way to practice is by playing clicker games, such as cookie clicker. Clicks per second is important on how your fingers are positioned. Make sure your fingers are stretched over your mouse.
Practice your CPS athttps://cpstest.org/or other sites.
Though, sometimes higher cps doesn't work as there is cooldown in some items.
Also, please do watch out not to use drag click or other high cps clicking methods (this even counts if you doing by your hand) . Doing that will give you over 20 cps and the game will ban you if you have too high of a CPS because Bloxd.io thinks you are using autoclicker as cheating is not allowed.
Timing Hit
Even more important than CPS alone is timing your hits correctly. In Bloxd.io, damage is only registered every 0.4 seconds. So spamming 30 CPS won’t actually land more hits.That’s why the ideal CPS is around 12–16, or up to 20 if you can maintain control. But even a well-timed 2.5 CPS can deal similar damageifyour hits are timed perfectly. PvP isnt just about CPS, it’s about landing hits when they count.
Bloxd PvP isn't just about swining your weapon, it's about movement, aim, and later on, your ability to adapt to your opponents fighting style.
The foundation of pvp is movement: . Use "A" and "D" to strafe from side to side and make it harder for your opponent to hit you, and use "W" or "S" to move closer or further from your opponent. Avoid running straight toward them or backing up in a straight line, as it makes you easier to hit.  Also try to move in a circular formation when attacking. Aiming is also very important, keep your crosshair on your opponents to make sure your hits land. Don't just click as fast as you can, control where your crosshair is so your hits deal the most damage. If you are moving to the right, move your camera to the left, If you are moving to the left, move your camera to the right to keep your crosshair on your opponent.
Once you've mastered these basics, you'll be able to move on to more advanced tactics, but getting these right will already give you a strong advantage.
Keeping on hitting enemies are also important. Try to move forward if they got knocked back while quickly clicking. Do not let them touch you again. If the combo breaks, instants alter between left and right, keep clicking and you could still build combos again.
When you hit someone in midair, you deal 30% more damage, or 1.3x. This used to be 1.2x until it was buffed. This is a Critical Hit, or Crits. Crits are nice-to-have and could help you deal more damage.
Trees can also be used to escape and spam crits withHead-Hitter jumps.
Your first hit while sprinting deals extra knockback, so stopping your sprint while doing combos can help you hold a longer combo.
If you are in a fight, keep you eyes peeled on your health bar for heals or boosts. You may get killed without noticing if you don't, so keep that in mind.
This is generally different from other PVP mode as you don't keep your inventory, and for new players in a lobby, losing everything is a big discouragement. You can practice pvp with your friend or in gamemodes designed for PVPing.
This is surprisingly one of the most important factor to consider. All diamond armor let you survive a whole FIVE times longer, so you should always make sure you have sufficient armor in fighting, especially in gamemodes where your inventory are not kept like survival or faction. Try to get decent armor before challenging someone.
This is also extremely important in PVP, and these are the key food item you need to know about: a damage II potion more than doubles your damage output, and you can one shot a slightly armored player with a diamond bow under the effect. a defense II potion lets you survive twice longer (a total of ten times longer if you have diamond armor.) a speed II potion lets you run twice as fast, a jump II potion lets you jump 7 blocks high (basically a basic fireball jump everytime) a shield II potion let you survive 1.5 times longer, a splash instant heal II heals 60 health, a splash knockback  II potion takes you over 48 blocks high into the air if used right (throw it right under you to be lauchned high).

Raworeswere added on 6/5/25. This update made the gold and iron ores to convert them into raw gold and iron. Like normal ores, you can smelt it into bars. The raw ores can’t be crafted into blocks either. Mining with any pickaxe (except for Moonstone Pickaxe) can turn them into raw ores.
On the update of rawores, DFS added a kind of funny pun that said, “Smelt me to get a/an (Ore) Bar”.

Rocket ObbyInfoDescriptionUse rocket jumps to beat challenging mapsDeveloperTomScript NamerocketParkour
Rocket Obby is agamemodeadded on September 24 of 2024, and taken out of Limited Time on October 25 of 2024. The goal is to use the the Rocket Spleef's RPGs to boost yourself up and finish the parkour.
There are currently two maps available. Previously, this was a Limited Time gamemode, in a competition againstLucky Towersmode. The first map is made entirely out of Wool, the second map is made out of chalk bricks, wool, etc.
You use the RPG to jump, just like aFireball Jump, with the benefit that it doesn't deal damage. Before the update on October 4th of 2024, you could only have 1 RPG at once and it refilled quickly. Now with the new update, the RPG has an launching animation acting as a cooldown for the weapon. The RPG works on all coloured Wool except for Black and Purple, where it doesn't launch you upwards. There is also Red Wool in some places, which when stepped on teleports you back to the previous Checkpoint. Checkpoints are represented by Yellow Wool. You can still bounce off Red Wool if you fire the RPG just at the same moment as you land on the Red Wool, before you teleport back. This can be used to jump over larger areas or save yourself from dying.

5Trivia
Rocket Obby is a game mode added on September 24, 2024. This game mode is an Obby or Parkour mode but the way of obby and parkour is different from normal when you have to use RPG to play and when you touch the yellow wool block (Checkpoint block), the time will start counting. If you set a new personal record, the chat bar will show the username and completion time, which will be green. If you didn't set a record, the completion time will be white. If you get a lobby record, the chat bar will be gold, meaning you beat the time of all players. The personal record time is saved for all the lobbies you play, so don't worry that you will lose that record except for some things. There is a lime colored bed, if you right click or press E on it, your jump time will reset to 0 and you will return to the spawn point. If you finish the map, you will get a gold helmet.
Wool blocks are used to build the map and the colors are also very important, black is the color you can't jump on and don't jump on that block, and the black wool block at the finish line is the same, can't jump. Red, if you touch the red wool block, you will go back to the checkpoint. Yellow, you can set a checkpoint here and when you die, you will go back here, but note that you need to stand there, if you skip, you will not be able to go back to that checkpoint. The other colors are the colors you can jump on and you can climb by standing in the corner of the block and using RPG, you will jump. As for purple, when you reach the finish line there will be a hole for you to jump down and that hole is the hole to return to the Spawn point and continue jumping.
Time is a thing in this game mode. When you finish the game for the first time, that will be your record time. After a few times, if you don't reduce the time (ie record time). And if you get a record time, on the chatting line, it will say [player] finished in [number of seconds] and look at the color of [number of seconds], if it's white, it's not a record time, if it's green, it's a record time. In order to see other people's best time, you can press [g] on computer, or the icon with 3 dots and 3 lines next to each of those dots on mobile

WR: Unverified
Rocket Obby andRocket Spleefhave a lot in common as it uses RPG and has the word "Rocket" in it.
You can climb walls by using RPG on the corner of the wool block (not black).
Rocket Obby andLucky Towerslikely was in a Gamemode Vote.
The player's name on the (Old) Thumbnail was AmusingEagle2347856.
Even though you can't get damaged, the health bar is still there.
The wool blocks are similar togreenvile, yellow wool sets a checkpoint and red wool kills.
When you land after using an RPG, you keep your momentum until touching the ground for a bit.
The gamemode is no longer a Limited-Time Game on 25 Oct. 2024.
There is a method you can use to easily finish the obby known as a "wall-hop". The video ishere.
A glitch on this gamemode is called a "wifi-glitch", where you momentarily disable your wifi during a run, causing the timer to "pause", and when enabling your wifi mid-run, the timer will start normally, starting at 0, allowing for sub-4s times.
The world record for the Map Sheep is 5.810s, though it is not verified, completed by the player Hampleton2_YT, meanwhile, the verified world record is 5.871s, completed by the player Boxiconiq.
There was a glitch where when worldedit was added, players can complete the map in under 1 second.
Rocket Obby plays the same music asEvil Tower.
Before, to maintain momentum, you have to release your joystick/keys to keep going. Now, you have to still hold on the joystick/keys to keep moving.
If you are stuck on a particular area for too long, the game will automatically send you to the next checkpoint.

Rocket SpleefInfoDescriptionFire rockets and be the last one standingDeveloperTomScript NamerocketSpleef
Rocket Spleefis a gamemode where players battle each other with Rocket Propelled Grenades (RPG) in an attempt to kill them or knock them into the void. Everyone spawns in with 3 charges of RPG and aHang Glider, which you can change by buying other Weapons. You can break the arena floor with the RPG and potentially push people down. You get 10Coinsper kill, and you also get up to 240 Coins when you win.

8 August, 2024: Added to Bloxd.io.
9 August, 2024: Removed from Bloxd.io
19 August, 2024: Added to Bloxd.io in a gamemode vote againstRush Racing.
30 August, 2024: Major update added by Tom. Added kits, loots, and new maps.
At the beginning of the game, everyone spawns on the middle platform and the side platforms on specific maps. Use your weapons to knock off as many players as possible or break the Blocks under their feet so they fall into the void. Don't use the rockets solely for killing others, but also for propelling yourself into the air, similarly to aFireballjump. This is the key to Rocket Spleef success. The death height is at y level -50, so even if you fall from the platform, you still have enough time to teleport back up using a Moonstone Orb. Island Loot will start spawning very quickly. After all other players except two have died or a long time has passed, Moonstone Explosive will start spawning wherever the players stand. This prevents the game from being really long, as all the Blocks will subsequently break and the players will fall to their death. Once this starts, it becomes very hard to kill your opponents because you need to focus on not getting killed by the Explosives. Eliminating a player gives you 10 Coins. You only get the Coins if you were the last person who damaged the enemy before they fall into the Void. For winning you get at most 240 Coins, but less if the game started without the lobby being full.
RPG in hotbar
Super RPG in hotbar
The RPG looks like a darkish-greenFireballwhen you shoot it, however the icon for RPG in the hotbar isn't like a Fireball icon. It destroysBlocksjust like aFireball, but it deals much less damage to players. You can also self-propel with the RPG (although it works best with Super RPG).
As the game progresses, Items start spawning in the arena. They appear on the smaller islands surrounding the middle. This list shows all of the items that can spawn in the game currently:
The Weapons can be purchased at the shop. You can access the shop by pressing [B].

This is the first map of Rocket Spleef and it appears on the mini screen of this game mode. The map has 2 large circles one above the other and several smaller lily-pads.
This map was introduced by creator Tom as Burger, on the same day Tom also introduced some updates to this game mode. On September 10, 2024, Tom removed the Egg and Cheese part to make the end time faster.
This map was created by JanuaryBoy, it looks like a construction site.
This map was also created by JanuaryBoy, just like the Construction map, it also looks similar. Unlike Construction, this map has several islands on all four sides.
This is the only game mode besidesBloxd HopandLucky Towersthat has a built-in sky box.
On the very first appearance of this new mode, you would get 80 Coins per win. This was changed to 100 very quickly, but it then got changed to 240. However, you only get 240 Coins if you win a game which started with a lot of players. If there are only a few players in the lobby, you will get less Coins.
The RPG projectiles are re-textured Fireballs with a heavy green/dark red /dark blue tint , depending on if it was the normal, the Super RPG or the Grenade projectile.
When it was re-added, there was a glitch that made it where if you got a kill you got double-payed with 10 coins. This has been fixed.
This gamemode surprisingly playsPiratesmusic.
There used to be a team colour called "Lilac". Since there was no LilacWool, the Lilac team just had no Wool on its cover. This was later changed to "Light Blue" but got moved to the back instead of being next to "Blue". Teams seem to be useless apart from choosing which position you start at or who you are next to, unless thedevsare planning on addingRocket Spleefwith teams.
Tomremoved Egg and Cheese in the Burger map to end the game faster.
This gamemode features two new Items: A Super RPG and a Gravity RPG.
There is a glitch with Hang Gliders. Players who abuse it can float in the air for a very long time. The best way to get rid of them is by continuously shooting RPGs at them or throwing the Splash Poison Potions until they die.

Structuresare groups of Blocks that are only naturally placed in a certain way. They can generate in different locations ofOpen Worlds. There are currently four types of structures in Bloxd.io, which are the: Mysterious Ruins, Lava Pools, Jungle Ruins and Frozen Ruins. They can be mainly found in open world game modes, likeSurvival,Peaceful,CreativeandFactions. There are extra preset structures inFactionswhich which are the shop, the camps, the Sand Mine and Wood Mill. However, they seem to be more of a utility instead of a naturally generated structure, similar to the work stations inGreenville.

Mysterious RuinsAll variations of ruinsInfoSpawns InPlains and forests (except cherry blossom forests)

Mysterious Ruins are mostly built out ofMessy Stone, Compressed Messy Stone variants and Stone Brick variants. Almost all Ruins haveVinesgrowing on them. Bigger Ruins also haveWoodand some even Patterned Glass. Loot Chests mostly containFood, SmeltedOres,Tools, Armorand building materials like Stone, Concrete or Ceramics. They do not contain Diamonds, Moonstone or Diamond Equipment like Armor, except in secret chests. All ruins haveMob Spawnerson them, all of them being hostile mob spawners.
The ruin have many varieties, which includes castles, churches, walls, statues, forts, colosseums and even normal ruins without ANY special loot.
Loot chests can contain anything from coal and bread to even diamond tools and armor. Some loot chests are even buried underground so be sure to bring a shovel along. Usually, the harder it is to find the chest, the better loot it contains.



Lava PoolA bugged Lava PoolInfoSpawns InAnywhere

Lava Pools are made out of Stone, Compressed Messy Stone, Magma and Lava. Sometimes, a Lava Pool might bug out and spawn without the solid Blocks, just Lava. They spawn in various shapes and sizes, usually adapting to the surrounding area
All lava pools are surrounded by Magma and Compressed messy stone.
Frozen Ruins are made out of many various blocks, but most haveStone Slabs,Messy Stone,Spruce Wood Planks,Spectral Log,Dirt, andSpawners. The Frozen Ruins contain aMob Spawner, which are all hostile. The chests containOres,Blocks, and variousTools, while both normal and secret chests found in the Skull Temples have a possibility of spawning Diamonds, Moonstone, and Diamond gear (Moonstone gear sometimes spawns).
There are multiple Frozen Ruin variations, some of which are gigantic, such as theSkull Temple, and some of which are small, such as agraveyard.There are two types of hut one with a spike trap and a small graveyard type thing in front with one spawner and a larger hut with 3 chests and one spawner. Some Frozen ruins also spawn likely to the normal ruins.
Ruins spawn in the Plains and ForestBiomes, but it'll be easier to find them in the Plains Biome since there's no Trees blocking your view. If you're in a Forest, climb up one of the Trees, or find a Mountain and then climb on top of it to find the Ruins!
Alternatively, you can also eat a watermelon and pillar up before gliding away.
While looting the Ruins and Frozen Ruins, always dig deep around the Ruins to make sure there are no remaining Loot Chests left. But also beware of your surroundings because many hostile mobs might spawn around and ambush you while you are digging.
When they were first added, Mysterious Ruins had no Loot Chests in them.
There is one 'hidden' Chest for each ruin type, containing the best loot.
The Bookshelves in the ruins used to be Full Bookshelves that could be obtained.
There's two ruin variations which are cathedrals.
One of the Ruins has aTribelogo on the back of it.
It is possible that Ruins can spawn buried underground or flooded by a waterform. Ruins and Lava Pools can also spawn on top of each other.
Traps can actually naturally spawn in one of the ruins.
Magma also naturally spawns in the same ruin.
Lava can spawn really deep touchingbedrock.
Some ruins have mineral blocks. For example, one flag in one of the ruins hides a moonstone block, while another fortress- / castle-like ruin has a diamond block hidden under a staircase.
The pillars found in Frozen Badlands occasionally contain Diamond ore
Magma can also naturally spawn in Frozen Ruins
The Frozen Ruins can be extremely glitched, some of which don't even contain a spawner. And some of them might have half of the structure buried.

6Trivia
Players start in the "Island" map with a racing track. When there are four other players the game starts. Each player is seated in a Kart and there is a three-second timer before players can start moving. When a player drives around the race track three laps, the other players have 18 seconds to reach the end before the game ends.
There is currently only one map, Island. It's mainly made out of Stone, Messy Stone and Mossy Stone Bricks. The surface is covered with Aspen and Palm Trees. These Trees are artificial, meaning they were built by the map maker, as such Trees don't grow from Saplings. Some other objects can be found on the map, like a blue and white hot air balloon right above the finish line.
Lucky Blocks are Block Entities that appear in on the race track, when you drive through them, you will get an Item that has a special effect. Right click to activate the Item. Here is a list of Items you can get:
Hold “jump” (space if not customised) to “drift”. You will have the effect Drifting while you are drifting. You can navigate through sudden turns with this. Its Icon is the same as the Jump Boost’s. There will be particles flying out of your Kart while drifting. They will change colour if you drift long enough, first from gray to yellow (lv 1 speed boost), then cyan (lv2 speed boost) and finally purple (lv3 speed boost).  A Speed Boost is given after a long drift.
There is a short part of the track where your Kart gets replaced by an IronHang Glider. Just fly around a bit and you'll be teleported to another section of the track. After a three-second countdown, you will continue with the Kart again. Note that this place contains the most glitches as the user can crash into a block and glitch out.
The gamemode is extremely laggy due to having manyEntities. You might not be able to move when the race starts. Try clicking and right clicking. If it doesn't work, find a new lobby.
This gamemode lets you move your camera to the front, which doesn’t happen in other gamemodes.
There is only one map called Island. There are some secret areas in the map that could be accessed through spectator mode.
When you go the wrong way, a chat message will appear: "WRONG WAY!!"
When you enter the net, you will see a spinning effect.

The salvaging table looks like an anvil with a hammer on wood.
The salvaging table can salvage tools to turn it back into the ores. When the tools gets salvaged, they will give you the ores that needed to create this tool. When you salvage the ores, you will get Aura XP Fragments. This utility block can only salvage armor, ores, and every tool (except moonstone tools)
To craft a salvaging table, you need 4 Planks and 2 Iron (viaWorkbench).
This block can basically uncraft tools and turn ores into XP.
Different types of ores can give different amounts of XP fragments (e.g. 1 Iron Ore gives 1 XP fragment but 1 Moonstone Ore gives 5 XP fragment).
There is a glitch that allows for storage using the table and it is foundhere

These protect a Chunk (32 times 32 times 32 Blocks big cube). Only the person who placed the Protector can place and break Blocks and open Chests in the protected chunk. You can allow someone access to your Protectors and subsequently they can also break/place/open in the chunk. Remove their permission anytime.  A Protector is crafted with 1 Messy Stone and 2 Diamonds.Andesite, Granite or Dioritecan be used instead of Messy Stone. You can place a Maximum of 8 Protectors at once, even though you can craft as many as you wish.

Blocks near spawn (in the range of 192 Blocks in all directions) will be reset every 150 minutes (2 and a half hours). Do not build your base there if you don't want to lose it, but there are some skybases in above the 192 block radius by building up in sky.
It is recommended not to "Quick Play", but to join lobbies with long digit names like for example "48675293" (Don't press Quick Play because it will join a crowded lobby, it will also make it harder for you to collect Items and easier to die.
Survival is one of the sandbox trio thatArthurmade, being the last to be added.
Survival is the default gamemode forWorldslobbies.
Gunshave been obtained in Survival with glitches.
There are Chainmail Armor and even odd flashy Armor on the second thumbnail (the one with a bunch of players in armor with a bunch of weapons and tools standing on a grassy cliff), making it obviously AI-generated.
Survival mode changed its thumbnail on May 1, 2024.Cube Warfarealso changed its thumbnail on the same day.
You can build up 1000 blocks and place blocks over spawn to avoid getting damaged, even when another mob hits you.First ThumbnailSecond ThumbnailCurrent Thumbnail
You Set Spawn Point (right click on a Bed), then you destroy theBed. If you die, you will be revived at Lobby Spawn.
You can watch an ad to get tools or armour up to iron level. However, do it in a safe place, as you will not be able to control your character, so if a player or a mob is fighting you, you will not be able to fight back or run until the ad is over, which takes 5 seconds.

A Stone Pickaxe; important tool for beginners
Start by punching a Tree. It doesn't matter what type of Tree you punch. If you want a neat world, then you should break the Leaves as well. You should also break the Leaves if you are in a survival lobby forFood. TheWoodyou get from Trees can be used to craft basic Tools. The main Tool you want to craft is a Wooden Pickaxe. With this basic Pickaxe you can getStone. Stone Tools are better than Wood and can mineOreslikeCoal,Iron, andGold. This should help you get better gear.
Organize yourChestsand give them themes. Make sure to protect them! Here are some ideas:
Wood
Stone
Food
Valuables
If you’re new to a server, escape spawn. Run, no matter what.
After going far from spawn, get some Wood, Craft aPickaxe, and aWorkbench.
Slowly get Stone, Iron, Gold, then Diamond.
Tip: If you're on a server with a lot of people and most Ores are mined, just start collecting Ores near spawn since they reset over time.
After collecting a lot of Items, run far, far, far away, till you see little or no marks from others that have been placed. A good way to know that someone has been there is if you see Messy Stone. Messy Stone isn't generated spontaneously by the game, which means only players can create it.
Start sky-basing. Remember to break the Block under you. When you get to 96 Blocks above the surface (to avoid x-ray pack users) or higher, set home and place aProtector.
Jump down and get the resources you will need for a sky base (e.g., a lot of Wood).
Teleport back up and start building.
Organize your Items (It is recommended to put Chests on top, Block of choice as a marker and a Board with a list of things in the Chest like Planks, Logs, and Slabs.)
Get full Iron Armor and an Iron Sword. Teleport to spawn. Go kamikaze and get kills (kills won't give you XP or anything, but if you hold a grudge or feel a little bit silly, then go). Keep the loot and run. Then teleport back home. Always fight back unless you are very sure you can escape.
If you're rich and have a lot of Diamonds, you can use Diamond Armor and Sword to replace Iron to get kills easier (this is how a villain starts).
Also practice PvP inBedwars.
And that’s all the strategy. I hope you like it.
How to win:
Play with a friend, chat with them throughout the game. It's better to find an active player who is not a bot who would leave the second the game started.
Agree which of you goes to the center or to fight, and the other protects the Bed (depending on which of you is more active in the game)
As soon as the game starts, accumulate at least 32Coal(depending on how far away the center is) and buy wool for all theCoal(64) and immediately go to the nearest island with a Moonstone generator and from there build up to the center. If you haveIronat the beginning of the game, then put it in one of the Chests (depending on who you are playing with). You need to do all this very quickly.
Waiting and not attacking immediately usually isn't a good idea. Dying isn't a big problem as long as you still have your Bed. A kamikaze in which you lose some Wool and a Sword is great if you manage to break an enemy Bed.
If you are the last team and you can't find the last remaining person because he is hiding, follow these steps.(Warning: This may be regarded as cheating. It's not recommended unless the hiding player shows no signs of planning to attack you.)Log on to an alt account.Join theBedwarslobby you are currently in. This can be found in the top left corner.You will be a spectator and have flying. Locate the hiding player. Please note that this could take a long time.Make sure to go back to your main account and shake your mouse quite often. Otherwise, you will time out and be disconnected, forcing you to leave the game and causing you to lose the game.Once you locate the hiding player, kill him.

There is a way to hide so that no one can find you unless they use the tip above. Also, this is not recommended, as this is unfair play.Start the game by getting Wool from the generator.Head to the back of the team base.Fall off and place the Block downward.Repeat the first three steps multiple times.Repeat the first two steps one more time.Place a Block on the side of the downward pillar as far down as possible, just above the void death height.Jump onto the Block; you should be one Block from hitting the ceiling with your head.Place Blocks while traveling until you are directly below the base.Destroy the previously placed Blocks except the pillar and the Blocks below the base.Stand on the singular Block.Build a base around you.Wait.Win due to the other player giving up!

If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go full screen" or the F11 key, or use C to crouch.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the Bed. Try to be sneaky.
Before attacking other bases, if they have strong Bed defenses, you should prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and a Stick. After breaking their Bed, try hitting the players with the Stick if they are next to the edge.
You can also rush with 3 or even 4 if your sweaty or good. You need to think tactically for this. It's crucial to be either a good PvPer or parkourist.
If you fall off and died in early game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can upper your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
The main issue of this game is that you lose all points upon death, while many griefers love griefing you on towers with a sniper (TAR-21or AWP). Taking cover will not work nowadays as you could see nametags through walls. Do your best at running around, trying to get kills. There is never the "best" Gun. You should find the best Gun that YOU could use.
Try every Gun. Unlock all Guns. Most people goes best with MP40 or a Double Barrel, but that may not be you. Quick running Guns such as M1911 could be extremely strong as well, so try all of them!
Griefers snipe you on sky bases. Try build you own on a further location when you have enough Blocks. When it gets invaded, abandon that. It is really hard to reclaim and get back up once you've fallen. Also, if you prefer killing on the ground then do take cover under roofs sometimes to avoid sky snipers. Buy powerups at a safe spot as this is your weak point.
Use a Pickaxe for melee fights. A Pickaxe is crucial if you get attacked while reloading or if you run out of ammo mid-fight.
Try out all the Kits and choose the one that fits you most. Kits of rarity Legendary aren't always the best! Think about what you're good at and choose the Kit that is specialized for that.
Something you will really need in Pirates are jumping skills. Due to a lot of Explosives, the ships and islands get a lot of holes through which you can fall and die. Knowing which jumps you can do and actually doing them is crucial for surviving.
If an enemy places a Moonstone Explosive on one of your spawns, shoot it with a Fireball. This will hit the explosive and move it away. It doesn't matter if you killed yourself or your team mates with this as long as the spawn is still there!
As with Pirates, choose the Kit that fits you most and not the rarest one in your collection. Some Kits could be considered scams or jokes regardless of their rarity (like Guardian).
A strategy is to rush to the middle where the best loot can be found. Equip yourself and wait till just a few players remain. Then try to kill them.This strategy can give you more wins but less kills.
The other strategy is in killing as many players as possible. You don't even need to go to the middle island in all maps. The problem is that you will be easily killed by others who went to the middle and have much better loot than you. This strategy yields less wins but more kills and more Coins.
Buying all Guns isn't recommended. It's just spending points while you mostly won't even need the Guns. If you are Veteran or Swordsman, this applies especially. If you are alone and hoarded by a lot of Zombies, no Gun can help you.
The main strategy in Infection is being a good team. One lone player needs to be extremely good to make any progress. This applies to Humans and Zombies.
The easiest way for Humans to win is by farming Zombie kills in a corridor. All maps have at least one good farming corridor near the start of the map. For optimal farming you need about half Humans and half Zombies. Humans stand at one end of the corridor and shoot the Zombies coming into the corridor at the other end. Humans are (almost) invincible at this. You will collect thousands of points in a matter of minutes. After everyone has a lot of points, just run. The Zombies won't catch up with you.
Not a lot of skill is needed to play Bloxd Hop like an average player. Just learn how to jump and sprint-jump.
Speedrunning Bloxd Hop is a different matter. You will need to be very precise when doing jumps. Learning toB-hopis recommended.
How to get sub 20s on all maps
Make a private bloxdhop world
Keep typing /rtv in chat until you see the red/green map
Go the the first Gold Block
Press R to reset your position
Repeat steps 3-4 this until you have at least 80 coins
Buy Jump Boost
Repeat steps 3-4 this until you have at least 120 coins
Buy Speed Boost
You should now be able to reach the gold block in 1 jump
Repeat Steps 3-4 until you have at least 270 coins
Buy Double Jump
Complete the parkour and reach the emerald block
Repeat Step 12 until you have at least 1200 coins
Buy Triple Jump
Repeat Step 12 until you have at least 3000 more Coins!
You are now rich (and have the ability to complete any map in less than 20 seconds)!
There are however some things to keep in mind:
Buy the jump and speed boosts in the level section to get a faster time.
Reset map time if it is about to run out.
After you are rich enough, try to get richer (such as 10000 coins) so you can start from Step 14 right away.
You can do the events to speed up getting coins
If you go toThis linkthen you can unlock a secret "Rewards" section in bloxdhop's shop. You can then watch an advertisement to get 30 free Gold Coins.
Bloxd Hop isn't just skill. Think about the jumps you will do. Discover which jumps are possible by trying it out.
Practice makes perfect. The most important thing at Bloxd Hop is practicing a lot.
A bit more of skill is needed to play Evil Tower. The maps are all different, but each separate floor is always the same. Learn each floor and you'll soon be able to complete the maps! Try practicing Bloxd Hop for a bit before starting with Evil Tower.
If you're not trying to speedrun but just want to reach the top, try crouching at the edges of Blocks and before Clay. You can also always use Boosts if you have enough money. Keep in mind that some Boosts , especially Speed, can mess you up if you're already very used to the usual jumping.
Seeing "compare number of mined blocks" is a problem in this game mode and these are the fastest ways to mine really fast.
Turn off chat to avoid being disturbed
Sub account required for faster mining
Use the right tools for the right block
Avoid AFK
Once you reach the Moon phase (the final phase) of the game mode, choose the easy phases (Plains, Volcano or Underground), avoid phases with wood or using a lot of tools or too many chests (Plenty, Desolation, Dungeon).
If you still have not made it to the portal, do not go. When you get bored after mining blocks on your One Block, you will get distracted and go to other's worlds instead of mining your own one block.
Put your Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel and Hoe on the first 4 hotbars
Left-Click to start mining
Continuously press 1, 2, 3 and 4 number Keys
This allows you to quickly switch to other Tools while mining so that you can use the tight tools for the right block
This trick works best with Diamond Tools so that you can mine fast
Using this with the Rainbow Phase works best as there are only 2 types of tools needed and they can be mined fast
You can also use Moonstone Tools but take note that even though you will mine faster, the Moonstone Pickaxe will give you the same block when mining so it may be a bit of a hassle re-mining the blocks to get Coal, Diamonds, Moonstone or Messy Stone
Learning how to bridge is an important thing to learn in the game. You will need it in a lot of gamemodes, and if you don't know how to do it, you really need how to learn to do it. It's required in lots of gamemodes like Skywars, Bedwars, and more! Here are the steps:
Get Blocks. A lot of Blocks. Get an appropiate  number of Blocks based on how long you want your bridge to be.
Before you bridge, you should be careful, the worst thing that could happen while you bridge is falling off, or getting killed while bridging. The best way is to pillar up or make stairs for your bridge. In Skywars, Pirates or Bedwars, it is good to make a staircase or pillar up before bridging. Never bridge to any place in Bloxd.io at ground level. Always get high before bridging. If you get attacked by Arrows,  Snowballs or Fireballs, etc, make a small wall on your bridge to block stuff like that. Then bridge while making walls.
Crouch by holding C on your keyboard or down arrow on mobile.
Turn around by moving your mouse to the right or left, dragging your finger on a trackpad to the right or left, or dragging your finger on your mobile screen (only do this on the middle-to right of your mobile screen to avoid moving your character)
Go to the edge of the Block you want to bridge from by moving back, but make sure you are still backwards.
With your bridging material selected look down and right-click (tap on mobile) the Block face that is facing in the direction you want to bridge in.
Repeat until the bridge is completed!
While crouching, it is almost impossible to fall off of your Block, you can fall only by jumping off, destroying the Block you are standing on, another player destroying your Block, or another player using a Tool to fling you off the bridge!
You can pillar up before bridging to avoid getting killed. To pillar, jump and place a Block before you land. Repeat until satisfaction.
To make a staircase, bridge a bridge two Blocks long, then jump and place a Block below you before landing, add another Block to the side, then jump and place. Repeat until satisfaction.
When playing faction mode, your number one goal is try to achieve a strong economy, and try to use one of the following method to farm materials to sell: mine at y=-86 to try to find diamonds and moonstones; Create a plot filled with saplings for lumbering; farm melons. These are the fast strategies to get a lot of gold.
NEVER let anyone teleport to you unless you have every diamond tools and is good in PVP or you know that's your friend. Otherwise, they will just kill you within their 10s immunity and take your stuff.
Building a base is also important. Make it very secret or get a protector.
Joining/creating factions are a much more minor thing for you if you are a party mode player(non-professional player). Just create a faction, get the protector, and throw a random base somewhere.
Always make your trade fast in Airship and crouch in it to hide your name tag, because players often hide there to kill others.
A really effective strategy in game is to warp to a market created by others. Check to see that no one of that faction is online, start a raid by pressing F, quickly break the chests containing valueable things (strength II potions, diamonds, gold, moonstone, etc.), end the raid, and go back to the market!
when building a base (especially in faction), consider the following:
first, your base's location should be ralatively hidden and far away from the spawn others and the 8 begginer camps in factions. Depending on your style, you have three types of good bases to choose:First, underground bases. The entrance should be as hidden as possible. For example find a river, go to the botton, and then pick a corner to dig down and build your base beneath.Note that never build your base too close to the bedrock layer, as people branch mining might accidentally run into it.Also, make sure your there is a layer of air between your base and the outer stones and use something like coal ores and iron ores to cover it so that people using x-ray texture packs packs wouldn't suspect a base there.Second, sky base. The sky base should be at least 130 blocks high so that even if players set their render distance to the highest, they still cant see your base without pillaring up.Third, on land bases. These bases are prone to raids in faction mode, but with proper defense and enough player in your faction, it is not a problem. Make sure there is an underground/sky section in your base though, just so that you still have somewhere to hide and store valuable things.

Back in Bloxd.io old days, there used to be a control named "Reduce lag" which was valid for 1 day and later got removed. However this control is so rare, that even if you get into the old versions of Bloxd, you won't find it. It was removed from all versions of Bloxd. Therefore this control is impossible to find, Arthur had to remove it because it was so overpowered that it could destroy the computer as it puts more pressure to the PC of the computer.
Adds a texture pack for the game. Seeherefor more.

Sheep’s were added to the game on December 20, 2024, though mobs (like pigs) were introduced already.

2Trivia
Sheep's were introduced earlier and have been introduced as a way to create wool blocks.
Sheep’s can spawn either near flower bed and rivers but they can’t spawn in deserts or any place with no grass unless a player uses spawn orbs.
Mutton drop rate used to be 100% dropping 1 piece. Now it’s 100% dropping 1-3 pieces. Consuming raw mutton gives a 18hp boost, but also poison for 4 seconds. Consuming Cooked Mutton removes the poison effect but also uses 1 coal. A way to omit the Poison effect if you are very low on health, you should eat Raw Mutton until you are at full health. Even though the Poison effect will still be present, you will get to 85 HP after doing so.
Sheep’s don’t have a certain movement they just tend to go back and forth or really just wander around the place randomly. Though if a player does hit them the sheep will run away from the player for about a few seconds.
Sheep’s just make the "baaa" sound
If you have creative you can get the sheep spawn orbs which spawn sheep, you can not get spawn orbs in survival though, ONLY in creative. However, even if you have spawn orbs, you can only spawn a fixed amount in each lobby, and can't spawn them too quickly.  Chat box will show the error messages: "Can't spawn too quickly" or "Too much mobs in lobby"
You can get shears and shear a sheep with the shears and get some  white wool!
If you have a diamond sword you can hit a sheep 2 times making them despawn faster.
When using spawn orbs they will only work if there are no mobs around you, but there is a limit to how many spawn orbs you can use which is 10 (so far).
The mob drop rate used to be 100%, then 38.5%, then 300%
Sheep’s don’t attack players at all or even do any other damage to other mobs.
You can take sheep’s wool without killing them by just simply using shears.

The player starts out in a map. The message will say what will you do. If you do the message tells you, then you get a point. Each points varies on how quickly you finish it. For example, if you were told to hit a person with a red mushroom, it will varies the time you do. There are 3 places: 1st place, 2nd place, and 3rd place. These places awards you different points, resulting you higher and better scores. The Simons will also varies:

SkywarsInfoDescriptionFight to the death in the sky!DeveloperStardue
Skywarsis agamemodeadded byStardue, a Bloxd.iodeveloper. According toArthurandStardueon the Discord, this, along with the improvedPrisongame mode, are both on Bloxd.io and are competing against each other in the game mode vote since both of them are inLimited Time Mode.
On November 20, 2023,Skywarswon the vote againstPrisonand was added as a permanentgame modetwo days later. The progress made during the vote is kept.
12 players spawn on islands and have three (or two)Chestswith randomItemsin it (StoneToolsandBlocksare guaranteed). Three-Chest maps have two on the surface and one in the basement (Sometimes 1 on surface and 2 underground, depends on maps or spawn island), while two-Chest maps have one on surface and one in the basement. Players must often take apart their islands in order to get Blocks and bridge to other islands. The point is to fight and kill everyone, until only one player is left.  After 7 minutes or when there are 2 players left, all players are given Compasses which point to the nearest alive player, to prevent hiders. If a player dies, they lose the game, and the player who killed him or her receives 5 Coins as a reward. The winner gets 20 Coins as a reward.
Coins can be obtained by killing a player (+5 Coins) or winning a match (+20 Coins). 100 Coins can be used to buy a random Kit. If a Kit  is already owned, the player will receive a random amount of Gems as an reward.  If you have all Kits, it is a great idea to grind for perks!
Gems are used to buy Kits and can only be obtained by purchasing the Mystery Kit, which now has a high probability of giving you Gems. Gems can be used for mini-upgrades (perks) such as "Maniac," "Blacksmith," "Bridger," "Arrowhead," and "Leech." These perks each have their abilities and can help you in battle. Also, you can use Gems to buy Kits, but it is really expensive (you need to buy around 500 Mystery Kits to get enough Gems to buy a rare Kit.). You can equip up to infinite perks at a time, as long as you have bought the level I of the perk. However, you still gain about 2-5 Gems per purchase.
Loot can be found in Chests placed on spawn islands and in the middle islands. The loot in the middle islands is better.Here is a list of different loot you can find:
Maple Wood Planks in stacks of 16
Messy Stone in stacks of 16
Wood/Iron/Gold Armor
Wood/Stone/Iron Pickaxe/Sword
Wood/Stone Bow
Arrows in stacks of 10
Snowballs in stacks of 8
Pebbles in stacks of 8
Fruits
Bread
Maple Sapling
Seeds
All of the previous and in addition:
Diamond Boots/Helmet
Gold Sword
Iron Bow
Stone Crossbow
Potions
Splash Potions
The maps are played in this cycle: Jungle, Food, Cube, Mushroom, Street, Lego, Ice, Castle
Some of the maps haveDiamond Ore, which means that if you get an Iron Pickaxe and Planks, you can craft a Diamond Sword in these maps. Maps that include quick Diamonds to mine are: Crossroads (too rushy, rarely used), Castle, Ice and Mushroom.
When perks are just introduced, there were only 4 single-tier upgrades.
When Gems were a new concept, you got around 8-10 Gems per purchase, now you get 2-5.
The amount of Gems you obtained while purchasing a Mystery Kit is defined by the following process:You purchase a Mystery Kit with 100 coins, then the game picks a random Kit for you.If you do not have the kit yet, it will be added into your collection!If you have the Kit, the game determines the rarity of the Kit, then it give a certain amount of Gems respective to the Kit's rarity.
You purchase a Mystery Kit with 100 coins, then the game picks a random Kit for you.
If you do not have the kit yet, it will be added into your collection!
If you have the Kit, the game determines the rarity of the Kit, then it give a certain amount of Gems respective to the Kit's rarity.
16 Wood Planks are guaranteed in the surface spawn Chest of the Mushroom map.
Most rare Kits are added in the further potion updates, making them harshly added in Kits, although some do work well to this day. (e.g. Catapult, Frog. They are really competitive in some maps.)
When Stardue added Newbie Kit, they wanted it to be a competitive Kit that everyone could obtain (common rarity). What they forgot is that they added the Tank Kit in the last update, also being common rarity. The issues with this is: Tank (full Wood Armor)  Newbie (full Wood Armour,a Wood Sword and 16 Glass)This made the Tank Kit WORTHLESS. The Troll Kit also has full Wood Armor while having other Items. These 2 Kits made Tank a colossal joke.
In old Sky Wars, it was possible to getMoonstone orbsin mid Chests. It was removed after the loot re-balance.
In old Sky Wars, you got 10 Coins per kill and 30 per win.


The Kits are permanent perks that a player can obtain by buying a "Mystery Kit" that gives you a random Kit (can be duplicated) or by buying a specific Kit with Gems. You can only equip one Kit at a time. A list of the existing Kits is shown below. If you want more information and how to play them, clickherefor strategies.
Perks can be bought and upgraded with Gems. They give different effects and can sometimes be game-changing. You can equip up to infinite perks at a time, as long as you have bought the Level I of that perk.


Maps have two main concepts:RushyandClassic.
Rushy Maps include Simple Lego Map (see below) and Cube (chess map). They are really quick maps and you can jump to other's islands. They usually end really fast and Mid islands don't serve that much purpose.
These maps are called "classic" because of the first ever Sky Wars map "Jungle" or "default". They are divided to three parts: Spawn, Semi Mid and Mid.
Spawn island are usually far from other's and need some time to bridge to. You will have 2 players as your neighbors. There will be 4 "Neighborhoods". Most of the time, you are ought to bridge to other's island first before going to semi mid (You may get backstabbed by not doing this), after defeating the other 2 player in your quarter, you can move to the next section.
After entering this, there will be oneChestthat has the loot fairly similar to loot at  the actual mid. After getting some loot, you can get to mid. Prepare yourself. You will encounter a big fight.
The FINAL war. Only the best players of each quarter will be here. LOTS of Chests with OP loot. You have to be ready to be backstabbed any time. Run around. Kill if you can, FLEE if you can't! Good Luck on the fight.
Sky Wars FrozenMap Link:https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Map:Skywars_frozen_map_-_Pigiama-Party-Crew
Really nice map, features a center that almost resembles a snowflake. You start on an island and have to get to the middle.
Keep in mind that there is usually another Chest below your feet. If you have an Iron Pickaxe, You may even be able to mine those Diamonds down there! Also, in some islands you can DIRECTLY JUMP TO MID without bridging (by jumping on the icy Trees)! Beware, though! It is really easy to slip of since the floor is made out of Ice! The other advantage of the map is that you can collect Ice or Ice Bricks to save Blocks(and also for surprise attacking!)
Recommend kits:
Frog Kit (Jumping)
Builder/Disco/ Pharoah Kit (Bridging, and also enough hand Blocks)
Knight Kit (rushing)
Miner(Mine Blocks)

Skywars Castle MapMap Link:https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Map:Skywars_Castle_Map_-_Pigiama_party_Crew

The Map consists of 3 Huts in each corner of the map. Reach your way to the Tower to bridge into the Castle. It always has a nice view and is really fun to play in a slow paced style.
When Spawning, Loot the 2 Chests on the inside of your hut. Block off your door, and go downstairs. Look in the Chest and mine the Diamonds (There is enough Wood and Stone and Iron for you to start with nothing and end up with Diamonds. Crafting a Diamond Sword is recommended! You could easily kill enemies with this.

Simple Lego MapMap Link:https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Map:Simple_Lego_Map_(Sky_Wars)_-_SadClown
Funny Map to play. Map is represented by Legos. Usually the one that finishes very quickly. You start on an individual Brick and hop onto Bricks getting gradually bigger.
There are three cobwebs in the bottom of the brick where you spawn, grab them! They might come in handy! The smart idea on this map is also to get to mid early and climb to the top roof of the mid.
A smart strategy for this map is to build a small bridge to semi-mid, then you could directly jump to mid from there.
Recommended kits:
Frog Kit(Skip the first bridge to semi-mid, you can jump from semi to mid without Blocks),
Builder/Disco Kit(Blocks),
Knight Kit(Rush),
Archer Kit(Be a jerk and snipe away),
Engineer/Bomber(quickly get Chest loot in mid),
Model(good for any map)

Very Quick Map. Map consists of 12 green islands, separated by jumping distance. In the middle is a road with cars on it. Mid has 3 Chests: 2 on each edge (hidden under cars), and one in the back of one of the yellow cars in mid. Most players get eliminated very quickly because of the distance between islands, and make the bold decision to loot their Chests.
Recommended Kits:
Knight/Warrior Kit, Anything that has a sword. (Rush)
Ghost(Third party)
Model(easy Armor, do quickly get a Stone Sword from surface Chest.)
Newbie(Sword, Blocks, Armor.)

When spawning, You have two Chests to loot on the surface and one Chest that's underground. Two are across from each other, and one is in the secret hatch with a furnace. It is recommended to loot them quickly and bridge/jump to someone else's island. The Trees are tall enough that when on top, you can jump to a person’s island easily. Vines on Trees allow clutches without bridging.

Archer/Farmer/Snowman (for sniping)
Knight (Quickly kill people near you)
Miner/Builder/Pharoah (Bridging)

Big FoodsMap Link:https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Map:Big_Foods_-_January_Boy

Big Foods is a combination of smaller islands building up to a large main center. Hop onto food Blocks and go inside them to find loot! This was one of the first ever maps that was not made by a dev. It was submitted over Discord in a forum. (Great Job January! :)) There is a really cool semi-mid with two Chests!
Screenshots:
When spawning, You have two Chests. One above and two below. It is recommended to bridge over to your foes and kill them, or get to the first semi-mid map that has 2 Chests! Make sure to get to the center. Each array of Melons has 2 Chests. One in each Watermelon block by the ladder. There are also Chest osn top of the Pears, don't miss that! Slowly get to mid and be the last one standing! This map has the most Chests at mid island.
Recommended kits:
Lumberjack (Rush and bridge!)
Model (Quick Armor)
Frog (rush before anyone does!)
Recommended Perks:
Maniac/Leech (Always good for fights)
Inferno (prepare for a fight at mid by getting some kills at semi-mid!)
These are some overall tips, not pin-pointing on specific maps or kits.
Effect Foods are really important. You may kill people that out gear you with them.
Practicing parkour isn't ethical, but it can sometimes help or even save you life, especially if you are low on Blocks.
Do NOT use the same kit the whole time. Changing kits could depend on maps, your gaming equipment(such as your mouse or your keyboard) or even your mood.
PvPis really important in Sky Wars, so practice PvP on other PvP gamemodes.
Hiding will NOT work, especially in the addition ofcompasses.  You will eventually be out geared and die.
Instead of hiding, you can try to rush people that are weaker than you, or just get loot and out gear others.
When you are in huge fights, always look around. Note that using 3rd person camera is a great idea sometimes.
When you encounter a great sniper, do random movements such as jumping in random directions. They will not expect where will you step next. Slowly get closer and try to kill them.
If you found yourself in a serious Bow fight, here is what you should do:Prepare a decent amount of Blocks (try to get some)(at least 60)Tower up while having a two Block high wall in front of youTake advantage in high ground. Try and snipe them, or just slowly bridge towards them and jump. Don't get sniped in the process.
Prepare a decent amount of Blocks (try to get some)(at least 60)
Tower up while having a two Block high wall in front of you
Take advantage in high ground. Try and snipe them, or just slowly bridge towards them and jump. Don't get sniped in the process.
Bridgingmethods won't be that controversial. Slow bridging may work too although god bridging (walk-jump, spam blocks) might help.
Get to mid as quick as possible unless you really need Diamonds in some maps. It has juicy loot and will increase your chances to win!
Try to identify you enemies' Kit at the really start. You could try to counter them, also think of the map.
If you have all the Kits, choose the Troll if there are more chests on the spawn island. If there are fewer Chests on the spawn island, choose the Model. Because if there are more Chests, it means there is more advanced Equipment inside...Can replace Troll's Wooden Equipment. And if there are fewer Chests, it means there is less chance of more advanced equipment inside. It is safer to choose the Model.

Big Foods is a combination of smaller islands building up to a large main center. Hop onto food Blocks and go inside them to find loot! This was one of the first ever maps that was not made by a dev. It was submitted over Discord in a forum. (Great Job January! :)) There is a really cool semi-mid with two Chests!
Screenshots:
When spawning, You have two Chests. One above and two below. It is recommended to bridge over to your foes and kill them, or get to the first semi-mid map that has 2 Chests! Make sure to get to the center. Each array of Melons has 2 Chests. One in each Watermelon block by the ladder. There are also Chest osn top of the Pears, don't miss that! Slowly get to mid and be the last one standing! This map has the most Chests at mid island.
Recommended kits:
Lumberjack (Rush and bridge!)
Model (Quick Armor)
Frog (rush before anyone does!)
Recommended Perks:
Maniac/Leech (Always good for fights)
Inferno (prepare for a fight at mid by getting some kills at semi-mid!)
These are some overall tips, not pin-pointing on specific maps or kits.
Effect Foods are really important. You may kill people that out gear you with them.
Practicing parkour isn't ethical, but it can sometimes help or even save you life, especially if you are low on Blocks.
Do NOT use the same kit the whole time. Changing kits could depend on maps, your gaming equipment(such as your mouse or your keyboard) or even your mood.
PvPis really important in Sky Wars, so practice PvP on other PvP gamemodes.
Hiding will NOT work, especially in the addition ofcompasses.  You will eventually be out geared and die.
Instead of hiding, you can try to rush people that are weaker than you, or just get loot and out gear others.
When you are in huge fights, always look around. Note that using 3rd person camera is a great idea sometimes.
When you encounter a great sniper, do random movements such as jumping in random directions. They will not expect where will you step next. Slowly get closer and try to kill them.
If you found yourself in a serious Bow fight, here is what you should do:Prepare a decent amount of Blocks (try to get some)(at least 60)Tower up while having a two Block high wall in front of youTake advantage in high ground. Try and snipe them, or just slowly bridge towards them and jump. Don't get sniped in the process.
Prepare a decent amount of Blocks (try to get some)(at least 60)
Tower up while having a two Block high wall in front of you
Take advantage in high ground. Try and snipe them, or just slowly bridge towards them and jump. Don't get sniped in the process.
Bridgingmethods won't be that controversial. Slow bridging may work too although god bridging (walk-jump, spam blocks) might help.
Get to mid as quick as possible unless you really need Diamonds in some maps. It has juicy loot and will increase your chances to win!
Try to identify you enemies' Kit at the really start. You could try to counter them, also think of the map.
If you have all the Kits, choose the Troll if there are more chests on the spawn island. If there are fewer Chests on the spawn island, choose the Model. Because if there are more Chests, it means there is more advanced Equipment inside...Can replace Troll's Wooden Equipment. And if there are fewer Chests, it means there is less chance of more advanced equipment inside. It is safer to choose the Model.

ASlabis aBlockcrafted from 2 other Blocks of the same type(e.g. a 2 Grass Blocks make 4GrassSlabs) at an Artisan Bench. Slabs are used for building and decorating and are not used in game progression.
Though Slabs look like a halfBlock, they are actually full Blocks-their hitbox and mechanics are the same as for normal Blocks. This might be misleading, so keep it in mind.

Slabs also can be placed vertically on the sides ofBlocks. This is important for building - it adds more detail. Slabs can be used to build stairs, chairs, tables and similar furniture or make a landscape look smother. Although it is very useful, it can be very confusing to place them due to their normal hitbox but half-Block appearance. Be careful when you place other Blocks, for example Flowers, on top of Slabs-it can look like the Blocks are floating above the ground.
To place a Slab on the floor, jump and place it straight under you.
Place the Slab against a Block for it to be in a vertical state.
To place a Slab that looks like it’s floating above the floor, place a Block on top of the spot where you want to place the Slab then somehow place the Slab on the bottom side of the Block.
When building with Slabs keep in mind that the Slab textures are slightly lighter than normal Blocks, This can be great if you want to make your build more diverse and detailed, however it can also be a nuisance due to the slabs standing out too much.
Slabs can be found inChestsinOne Block(all except Pear Slabs) - they are very common. Be careful! They could clog yourInventoryand it is suggested that you store them.
Some people use Slabs to quickly get to the social island inOne Block, though it would be a confusing bridge.
Slabs do not work withTexture Packs.
The Slab looks like it’s only half a Block high, but if you stand on that Slab, you will stand on 1 Block, so it may seem that you're fly hacking in minimal perspectives.
Fallen Maple Leaves are also Slabs and placing them works in the same way as with usual Slabs, but they are transparent Blocks, which means you can walk through them and can't stand on them.
August 14, 2024,Concretecan be made into slabs.

Sleeping was added to Bloxd on 6/20/25 (June 20th, 2025). By sleeping on either a leaf bed, normal bed, or a strong bed, you can get exclusive perks including  damage, haste, speed, and farming yield, each spanning different times depending on the bed type. For example, haste could be for 4 minutes on a leaf bed, or 15 minutes on a strong bed.

You will see yourself in 3rd person. A sleeping icon will also appear on your bottom-left side of your screen. Also, around 4 Zs will appears out of your head. Upon breaking the bed you’re sleeping on, you will stand up, and still see the menu. However, selecting a perk isn’t available.
While sleeping, you will find 5 different perks on your screen, which being damage, haste, speed, farm yield, and aura. These are important if you want to gain buffs. However, only 1 perk can be activated at a time.
There is a glitch where if a person is sleeping, and you break the bed by using the Custom Lobby Block (which is only accessible to Worlds), the player is still sleeping and will fall to the ground. You can then make the player seemingly levitate in the air by usingInvisible Solid.
If you attempt to sleep with the "Boating" effect (symbolizing that you are using the boat), and wake up, the boat will follow you around. The boat can’t be dismounted even if you crouch. This glitch also happens with Hang Gliders too.
There is a glitch where you can use Splash Knockback Potions to send players flying out of beds while sleeping.
You can die while sleeping by falling into the void.
Sleeping buffs cannot be stacked and only one can be applied at a time.
You can attack players while they are sleeping, kicking them out of bed.

Pine Grass
Pine Grass is a variant of Grass appearing in Pine Forests instead of Grass. Like Grass, it cannot be crafted, serving a simply decorative purpose.

4Trivia
Spikes increase in damage based on material type. This is a non-handled weapon that can be placed to deal damage and can help you farm continuously without your presence.
As of the time of writing of this page, Spikes can kill/damage mobs too.
This variant of Spikes does the lowest damage. It is crafted with 2 Wooden Planks and 2 Sticks with a workbench. This Spike deals 26 HP damage.
This variant of Spikes does more damage than the Wooden Spike. It is crafted from 2 Wooden Spikes and a Messy Stone. This Spike deals 32 HP damage.
"Walk over these to receive damage. Trap your enemies with ease!"- Official Game Description
This variant of Spikes does more damage than the Stone Spike. It is crafted from 2 Wooden Spikes and a Iron Bar. This Spike deals 40 HP damage.
This variant of Spikes does more damage than the Iron Spike. It is crafted from 2 Wooden Spikes and a Gold Bar. This Spike deals 44 HP damage.
This variant of Spikes does the most damage (in all but Worlds Lobbies). It is crafted from 2 Wooden spikes and a Diamond. This Spike deals 48 HP damage.
This variant of Spikes is only found in Worlds. It can only be obtained by Creative Mode. This Spike kills you instantly if you are in any of the survival game modes. In fact, this Spikes deals 100,000 damage, so there is room for survive this if you set your health or shield high enough by codes.
Traps are very dangerous after Spikes are added. When you fall into a trap, you cannot escape (teleport, return to spawnpoint, sethome, return to tribe home if you have tribe,...) because you cannot teleport to another place when you take damage and even then you have to wait ten seconds. If you have Moonstone Orb then you can be a little lucky. Traps are used in the following ways:
Method 1: Dig down a few blocks (higher than the player's height).
Method 2: Craft a carpet and place a block (not a carpet) next to the hole.
Method 3: Place a carpet next to the block placed above and place other carpets next to the placed carpet and destroy the placed block.
Method 4: Craft some type of Spikes (preferably diamond type) and place them under the hole.
And the trap is born! (I will add some images).
The picture that Arthur posted on Discord.
You cannot collect Kill Spikes in the normal (eg Survival) game modes but only in Creative Mode in Worlds lobbies. This may be because Kill Spikes were too overpowered, being able to instantly kill anyone (with under 100k hp).
Kill Spikes don't insta-kill, they deal 100k damage.
When posting on Discord, Arthur posted an image of this update with 6 types of Wood Spikes in it. There is also a player named "Patricson_Bloxd" in the image.
InGreenville, Spikes can damage a player even when PvP is not switched on in someone's house.
The first day when spikes are added, it could deal double damage by standing in both of the spikes, this is fixed the next day because this bug (using diamond spikes) could kill a player in full Diamond Armor in about 3 seconds.

Isle of GroveInfoDescriptionUnknownDeveloperMattzap

TheIsle of Groveis a sub-gamemode that can only be accessed by playing inGreenvilleor by using an invite link. This is not a main gamemode, as you cannot access it from the main screen. The Isle of Grove has two parts: the woodcutting zone is where you can chop Maple and Aspen trees, and collect their Leaves andApples. The farming zone is where you can collect Wheat and Hay Bales.
There is a huge area in the middle of the Isle of Grove that cannot be accessed.
If you travel carefully far enough, you can reach a different job (e.g. get from Farming zone to Woodcutting zone) If you die in here, you can respawn back at home while the lobby still shows "Isle of Grove". This can also be used for special glitches.
SpleefInfoDeveloperMattzap

Spleefis a sub-gamemode that can be accessed from the main page or through a portal. With skill, you can use the portal to get into the main parts of greenville!
When the game starts, the Snow under you starts to be breakable. Do not fall, or else you will die and lose.
"Kill" people by making them fall by breaking theBlockthey are standing on. You earn a small amount ofCoinsevery time you "kill" someone.
The arena will start shrinking after some time.
Last person standing wins! You earn a large amount of Coins when you win.
Note: The descriptions are fan-made and unofficial.
The Greenville population is expanding, and more houses have to be built, requiring moreWood. But how do you findWoodto cut? Here's the workplace for you.
Go to the Big Portal next to the Woodcutting zone (the area with Wood in the shape of benches). Then, you will be teleported to Isle of Grove.
After going through the portal, you should see many Trees. Chop the Trees down and sell the Logs for money andXPto level up.
Another way to enter the Woodcutting zone in the Isle of Grove is to jump off into the sea or the forbidden village in the farming area and you will be teleported to the Woodcutting zone.
You could use the wood there to decorate your house.
There is also a small Woodcutting zone in front of the Portal. You can chop down some Trees there. Note that these Trees don't drop Apples and Saplings though and also don't grow from Saplings like other Trees. They just reappear after some time. They're not effected by your Luck.
Not to be confused with Shop (see below)
Help your fellow customers to find the objects they want.How do you help them?Here's your part of the job.
Go to the big, brown building near the mining area.
Go to the first floor of the building. There you will seeFlowers,Wool,Ores, Ceramics, Baked Clay and otherBlocks.
Use your Tools to break the correct Item according to instructions given in white text.
Note: This isn't a really profitable job in early game, but in higher levels it is way more profitable than mining, farming or woodcutting, although your eyes could get tired.
There are too many obstacles blocking the town from expanding, so what do you do? Destroy them to earn money.
TheDemolitionarea is just in front of the woodcutting zone and at the left side of the Market. You will see a large build that is randomized between a stone dragon, a pyramid and a wood tower.
You earn money every 15 points you get. You get points from breaking blocks with yourPickaxeandAxe, harder-to breakBlocksgive more points.
You are equipped with a jetpack that allows you to jump at most 6 times.
When the entire build is destroyed, you gain a lot of rewards, and a new one appears.
Grab your hoe and cut some wheat! It's time to do some farming.
Go through the big portal made of Green Stone next to the farming zone (the area with wheat). You will be teleported to theIsle of Grove.
After going through the portal, you should see a big field of Wheat and Hay Bales. Cut them and sell them for money andXP.
Wheat for 2 XP per wheat
Haybales for 8 XP per haybale
A really good job that doesn't require much effort. There is also a smaller farming area in front of the Portal which works just like the other farming area.
It looks like the mine has collapsedand has been refiledwith treasure!Use your heavy-dutyPickaxeto mine the best and shiniest treasure you can find.
Go to the red tents. There should be a pit ofBlockssurrounded byBedrock. Mine theBlocksfor money andXP. There are different types ofBlocks.Clay gives you extra money andXP, and Golden Decoration gives you even more money andXP.
The more levels you have, the deeper and faster you can mine. Your backpack also gets a lot bigger upon leveling up. Starting size of the backpack at level 1 is 20, at the highest level the size of the backpack reaches 380. When your backpack gets full, you must return out of the mine to empty it and get Coins, otherwise you can't continue mining. You can also use F to multi-jump out of deep holes.
Note that you can jump much more and propel yourself upwards in the mining area. You can also use thecommand/up to teleport out instantly.
A decent job to play with and really profitable if you are in high levels.
You can actually get onto the the tents at Mining, the Spleef and Arena by going to the mine and then keep on pressing space. It will launch you into the air. While that happens, you walk towards Arena. You will be able to get onto the roof of the Arena, Spleef, of the red tents! It will be kind of funny if you do it while people are playing/battling in there. People will be very confused...
It's a dangerous brawl! Defend yourself using your sword and armor.
Go to the big dome of glass (not to be confused with the Spleef arena).
Invite players to fight in chat.
A really fun way to earn Coins, but not profitable as not many people will be at the Arena.
Note that yourItemsdon't drop when you die.
Access Fast Travel in the B menu. Fast Travel will teleport you to the location you choose. Note that you must first reach the job once on foot to unlock Fast Travel to that job. Fast Travel can be used to teleport to:
Town Square (no job there)
Mining
Spleef
Arena
Market
Demolition
Maple Woods
Aspen Forest
Wheat Fields
Hay Bale Valley
Keep in mind that using Fast Travel to Maple Woods, Aspen Forest, Wheat Fields or Hay Bale Valley (the entries in italics) will teleport you to an Isle of Grove lobby. This means you will not be able to chat with people who stayed in the Greenville lobby and your house there will disappear.
At the right side of your screen is a panel that shows your mood and level at different jobs.
Decreases when you do different jobs or just walk around for some time. A higher mood means more earnings at jobs. Increase mood by standing on aBed. The highest mood can get is 100% , and the lowest it can get is 0%. At Mood of 0%, your earnings/luck is decreased by 30%. This rises with the Mood and reaches 18% at 100% Mood.
Earnings level means you get x% more Coins every time you earn them at all other jobs except Farming and Woodcutting.
Luck appears at Farming and Woodcutting and means the chance of getting 2 Items instead of one (for example getting two Wheat when you harvest a growing Wheat) There is another Luck parameter that only appears at Farming and Woodcutting. It increases with the skill level at this job. It's not known what this Luck does though.
In addition there is also a Rest Level which is usually valued at a low number like 1 or 2. We believe its the level of the last bed you used (black: 1, magenta: 11).
Doing a job gives youExperienceon that certain job. When you get enoughXPyou level up. You need moreExperiencefor each level, meaning the first levels will be quickly reached while you'll have to grind for a long time to get to the highest level possible (Level 50). Being at higher levels further increases your earnings and unlocks new Minerals at Mining and new Items at the Market.
You can change certain things about your Houses in the B menu.
Rename House: Rename your House. Each of your Houses can have its own name.
Allow Entry: Decide whether people can enter your House or not. You will always be able to enter.
Allow Edit: Give a certain player the power to break and place Blocks in your House. This is a dangerous action due to griefers.
Host PARTY!: Everyone in the lobby will get a message that you are hosting a party. If they press Y they will be teleported to the entrance of your House. If they don't press anything or press N they will not teleport. You can only host a party every few minutes.
PvP: Enable or disable people being able toPvPin your House. When killed people will keep theirInventories. ThisPvPtoggle feature must be bought with 1000 Coins. After that you can use it as much as you want.
Parkour: Enable or disableParkourin your House. When enabled, Red Wool will kill any player if they step on it and Yellow Wool will serve as checkpoints. Orange Wool is the last checkpoint at the end of theParkour. This feature costs 1000 Coins. Once bought, you can use it as much as you want.
When you join Greenville for the first time, you get 4 Houses for free. When you earn a lot of money, you can buy more Houses. There are a total of 19 different Houses you can have. You can add and remove Blocks in all of your Houses.

First go to the Town Center in the B tab, then go to one of the following mini-centers: Woodcutting and Farming.
First you need 2 account, join a greenville world, allow edit for your account; put strong bed, a halft bed in your house and a half bed in your account 2's house, next change your house and break half bed, next return your first house you changed. There are half bed too! Is working now!
Mine some Haybales, and with the Luck effect from the Beds, you should be able to get more Haybales than there originally were. We are going to abuse this and place Haybales on top of the Grass around the house structure. When you mine the Haybales again, the Luck effect should give you even more Haybales than you placed, so you can repeat this more and more until you have the amount desired.
Note: this works quicker if you use a Moonstone Axe. Do the same thing as at Farming.
When it was still possible to getCoal, players could craftFireballs. In some parts of Greenville and the Isle of Grove, players could useFireballsto destroyBlocks, and if you were lucky and found some IllegalBlocks, you could shoot aFireballto destroy them so you could get the illegal Blocks. These blocks are:

Sometimes between October 10, 2023, and October 15, 2023,Arthurremoved allFireballsfrom all Greenville players. If a player touches aFireballthrough theInventoryor just the hotkeys, they will disappear and be removed from the game forever. It is rumored thatArthurwill also remove the IllegalItemssoon.
Around Halloween 2023, the IllegalItem, Pumpkin_placeholder, was replaced with another half-illegalBlock, which is also called Pumpkin. Players can now farm Pumpkins and get other half-illegalBlocks, such as:
Carved Pumpkin
Jack o'Lantern
Pumpkin Seeds
Iron Watermelon

On March 29, 2024Cottonwas added to the game and the crafting recipes forBows and Crossbowschanged.(Now you need Cotton to craft them).
Since there is no Cotton in Greenville, Bows and Crossbows are IllegalItems.

Sometime around the 4th of August 2024 a new glitch appeared. In the glitch you could createPress to get Boardsin GreenvilleWorlds. This meant you could get all items available in the Creative menu. Some of the illegal items included:
Pears and PearSaplings(and everything crafted from Pear Log)
Forget-me-not, Allium and Shadow RoseFlowers(and all types of Blue, Purple and Black dyed Items)
Bedrock
Cotton (and allWools,Bows,Crossbows,Hang Gliders)
Rice
Brown Mushrooms
Cranberries
Tribe Protectors
PurpleBeds
Ice and Ice Bricks
Red Sand and its variants
There are other new Items and especially a lot of new crafting recipes from Cotton and some newPotions.
Note: This was patched a short time after. The glitch doesn't work anymore.
Fireballs, IceballsandMoonstone Explosiveis now unobtainable. Griefers shoot them at the Greenville job buildings and destroy the Isle of Grove.  Note that Fireballs, Iceballs and Explosive will disappear from yourInventory.
There was a way to get Emerald Blocks in Greenville. Here are instructions on how to:
You needMoonstone Explosiveto blow up Emerald Blocks. Fireballs don't work. That is also the reason why Emerald Blocks weren't obtained in the previous glitch.
Create a Greenville Worlds lobby. Make apress to get boardfor Moonstone Explosive. Get as much as you need. (you will need at most 100 Explosive for a big amount of Emerald Blocks)
But for now, Moonstone Explosive cannot be obtained for this way, because the press to get boards are disabled in this world.
Fireballs, Iceballs and Moonstone Explosive will disappear from yourInventoryif you:
open aChestwhile you have them in your Inventory
leave and join any lobby while you have them in your Inventory
Drop your Explosives on the floor. Open a Chest. Pick up the Explosives while you have the Chest open. Put them inside the Chest. Leave and join a public lobby. Don't open the Chest. If you do, the Explosives will disappear. You must break the Chest to get them.
Explosives will disappear from your Inventory if you join a different lobby. You can't place or open Chests in the Isle of Grove so this technique doesn't work here.
Version 1 (if you are alone) :Join a Greenville lobby. Travel to the Isle of Grove. Press I and copy the invite link. Leave the game. Open a new tab and paste the link in. You will join the Greenville part of the lobby.
Version 2 (with the help of a friend) :Join a Greenville lobby. Travel to the Isle of Grove. The friend hosts a party and you accept the invite. You are in the Greenville part of the lobby.
Note: using the /home command doesn't work.
Now get your Explosives and walk to the portal to Farming/Woodcutting Area. Don't use any teleports! Go to the Sponge tower between the Maple and Aspen Forests. The tower is made mostly out ofDioriteon the outside. Climb up the big Tree next to it. You can break Blocks on the tree with an [[Equipment|Axe]]. Then jump or Orb to the top of the tower and blow up a part of the roof. You will find a cluster of Emerald Blocks on top of a lot of Sponges. Be careful when blowing up the Emerald. It is very tough so be patient. Do not blow yourself up with the Explosives. Note there is also a hole in the Sponges, which will teleport you back to the base of the tower if you fall into it.
There are otherIllegal Blocks, obtained in a similar manner, like Block of Lapis Lazuli and Invisible Solid.  The Invisible Solid can be found on all the ship in the Isle of Grove. It's next to the Trapdoors. Lapis can be in a smaller tower next to the big Diorite one. Both Blocks are hard to obtain as you need Moonstone Explosive to blow them. This throws the Blocks around. Finding invisible Blocks on the ground is hard (maybe try using aTexture Packsuch as Simple Better) and the chances of the Explosive blowing the Lapis Block into the forbidden area is big.
You can actually get onto the the tents at Mining, the Spleef and Arena by going to the mine and then keep on pressing space. It will launch you into the air. While that happens, you walk towards Arena. You will be able to get onto the roof of the Arena, Spleef, of the red tents! It will be kind of funny if you do it while people are playing/battling in there. People will be very confused...
Even though Spleef is a different part of Greenville, it has the same description. However, the description has absolutely nothing to do with the main goal, breakingBlocksunder the feet of players to make them fall into theVoid.
The Aspen Forest and Haybale Valley are only accessible by traveling far enough in the Isle of Grove.
In the middle of the Isle of Grove is an ocean that cannot be accessed.
Just like inOne Block, there is only one water source: theFat Cactus. They cost 25Coins.
What’s really funny is that when theDevelopersadded Spleef as a sub-gamemode, this happened: when you join a spleef lobby, it would be named “Greenville Spleef [ lobby number ]”. Seems normal enough, but for Greenville, it’s “Greenville Greenville [ lobby number ]“.
Greenville is one of the most glitched gamemodes, as there have been manyglitchesand dupes in its history.
For a very long time there was no way to get Forget-me-not Flowers and Pear Saplings in Greenville.
The Haybale Valley doesn't look like a valley at all so most people have trouble finding it.
If you do not have 100% energy and stand on anyBedyour Energy Level will return to level 1.
When entering the Arena, the welcome message will glitch and be replaced with "greenvilleGame:arenaWelcomeMessage". This is most likely the JavaScript code name for making the message.
When you kill someone in the Arena, the game might think you killed the player two times and give you morecoins.
Explosives now despawn from your inventory no matter what.
Greenville is currently the only new thumbnail to have no players in it.]
entering a house which has visitor access off will somehow state " you are not allowed to enter 's house"

Stags are hostile, they attack you if you get too close to them. They can only see you if they are 10 or less blocks away from you.
Normally they walk medium speeds, but when you come into their territory, they chase you at faster speeds. And when they attack you, they deal the more knockback than any othermob.
Venisonis dropped byDeerand Stags. When eaten raw, it gives you thePoisoned conditionfor 4 seconds and heals 12 HP. When cooked it heals 12 HP which heals the least out of all types of meat in bloxd.io.
Antlers are a decoration block dropped from stags. It is not a solid block but placeable none the less.
It can be placed on walls for decoration or can be combined to make small fossils.

Arthuris the creator ofBloxd.io. He is from the United Kingdom. Arthur once worked for Microsoft. When he found out that Microsoft was buying Minecraft, he quit the company and created his own game based on Minecraft. Arthur created the game engine via Noa (a free and open source game engine). Ayaan, an unknown coder, also helped Arthur on the development of the game.
The first game made with the Bloxd.io game engine wasBloxd Hop(formerly know as BloxdHop) byWeiqing. Arthur is friends with Mattzap. Arthur has also created over 15gamemodesforBloxd. He writes the updates he rolls out toBloxdon its Discord Server in the #dev-log channel in theBloxd Discord Server.
Dirty Flea Sack leaked how Arthur chooses new devs (starting from Stardue).
The “dev” (still unofficial) makes a game mode, it was added to a game as a lonely LTM for a few hours.
Arthur looks at the feedback of the game mode.
The “dev” soon creates another game mode, and it gets in a vote with the old one.
Then the dev becomes official.

Weiqingwas the initial developer ofBloxd Hop.Arthurfirst started working onBloxd.ioand then invited Weiqing to make Bloxd Hop using the Bloxd game engine. Bloxd Hop was the first publicly available bloxd.io game, dubbing Weiqing as one of the first creators of the game.
Weiqing and Arthur probably made the first game modeBloxd Hoptogether. Arthur gave Weiqing authority over Bloxd Hop, and Arthur worked behind the scenes making the bloxd game engine. After a while, Arthur took over development ofBloxd Hop, fixing bugs and keeping it up to date with the rest of the bloxd game engine.MattzapMattzap's Discord profile picture.GamemodesOne Block,Greenville,Murder Mystery,The Pit

Stone (obtained using Moonstone Pickaxe)
Stoneis a Block found underground or on the surface of mountains in OpenWorlds. It can be mined using aPickaxe, in which case it dropsMessy Stone. When mined without a Pickaxe, it drops nothing. If Stone is mined with aMoonstone Pickaxe, it drops itself.
Messy Stone (drops when Stone is mined with a non-Moonstone Pickaxe)
Stone makes up the majority of the solid Blocks generated underground in Open Worlds. When chunks generate, stone can be found under 5 layers ofsediment-type Blocks, which will vary depending on theBiome. When the world is generating new chunks, some Stone-type Blocks, including Stone, can be replaced withOreBlocks. They may also be revealed on the side of small hills. Stone-type Blocks also make up the several layers of Blocks below Bedrock, extending all the way to y level  -130. This layer of Stone can be influenced by the type of rock above it. For example, if the layer of Stone is in a Granite Valley Biome, it will become Granite instead of Stone.
Stone can be smelted from Messy Stone.
Diorite Block
Dioriteis a white type of Stone. It has its own Biome known as the "Diorite Caves" Biome. It is white with 4 small gray squares. The Block has a symmetrical design. When mined, it drops itself.
Granite Block
Granite is a brown type of Stone. It has its ownBiomeknown as the "Granite Valley" Biome. It is brown with dark brown squares around. It has white rectangles around forming a wheel-like pattern. When mined, it drops itself.
Andesite
Andesite is a grayish-blue type of Stone, very much indistinguishable from Stone if not for the blueish colour of it. It has its own Biome known as the "Andesite Pit" Biome. It looks like a Gray Concrete Block with lighter lines. When mined, it drops itself.

Sandstone and Red Sandstoneare also types of Stone with their own features.
These four types of Stone can all be used in crafting recipes. Making StoneEquipmentwill work with any of these 4 types of Stone and also Messy Stone. Stone, Granite, Diorite and Andesite can also be crafted into their Smooth and Engraved versions and into Bricks. This isn't so for Messy Stone. There are many other recipes including Stone.
There are some Illegal types of Stone like Block of Quartz and Greenstone. Clickherefor more.
Coalis black.Ironis beige, andGoldis yellow.Diamondis cyan, andMoonstoneis near-white with a light blue hue. AllOresalso have a grey background to blend in with stone. Iron Ore and Gold Ore must be smelted into Bars before crafting using Coal. AMoonstone Pickaxeis needed to obtain the rest of the Ores besides Iron Ore and Gold Ore.
Coal: y= 40 to y= -60
Iron: y= -15 to y= -80

A Stone Pickaxe; important tool for beginners
Start by punching a Tree. It doesn't matter what type of Tree you punch. If you want a neat world, then you should break the Leaves as well. You should also break the Leaves if you are in a survival lobby forFood. TheWoodyou get from Trees can be used to craft basic Tools. The main Tool you want to craft is a Wooden Pickaxe. With this basic Pickaxe you can getStone. Stone Tools are better than Wood and can mineOreslikeCoal,Iron, andGold. This should help you get better gear.
Organize yourChestsand give them themes. Make sure to protect them! Here are some ideas:
Wood
Stone
Food
Valuables
If you’re new to a server, escape spawn. Run, no matter what.
After going far from spawn, get some Wood, Craft aPickaxe, and aWorkbench.
Slowly get Stone, Iron, Gold, then Diamond.
Tip: If you're on a server with a lot of people and most Ores are mined, just start collecting Ores near spawn since they reset over time.
After collecting a lot of Items, run far, far, far away, till you see little or no marks from others that have been placed. A good way to know that someone has been there is if you see Messy Stone. Messy Stone isn't generated spontaneously by the game, which means only players can create it.
Start sky-basing. Remember to break the Block under you. When you get to 96 Blocks above the surface (to avoid x-ray pack users) or higher, set home and place aProtector.
Jump down and get the resources you will need for a sky base (e.g., a lot of Wood).
Teleport back up and start building.
Organize your Items (It is recommended to put Chests on top, Block of choice as a marker and a Board with a list of things in the Chest like Planks, Logs, and Slabs.)
Get full Iron Armor and an Iron Sword. Teleport to spawn. Go kamikaze and get kills (kills won't give you XP or anything, but if you hold a grudge or feel a little bit silly, then go). Keep the loot and run. Then teleport back home. Always fight back unless you are very sure you can escape.
If you're rich and have a lot of Diamonds, you can use Diamond Armor and Sword to replace Iron to get kills easier (this is how a villain starts).
Also practice PvP inBedwars.
And that’s all the strategy. I hope you like it.
How to win:
Play with a friend, chat with them throughout the game. It's better to find an active player who is not a bot who would leave the second the game started.
Agree which of you goes to the center or to fight, and the other protects the Bed (depending on which of you is more active in the game)
As soon as the game starts, accumulate at least 32Coal(depending on how far away the center is) and buy wool for all theCoal(64) and immediately go to the nearest island with a Moonstone generator and from there build up to the center. If you haveIronat the beginning of the game, then put it in one of the Chests (depending on who you are playing with). You need to do all this very quickly.
Waiting and not attacking immediately usually isn't a good idea. Dying isn't a big problem as long as you still have your Bed. A kamikaze in which you lose some Wool and a Sword is great if you manage to break an enemy Bed.
If you are the last team and you can't find the last remaining person because he is hiding, follow these steps.(Warning: This may be regarded as cheating. It's not recommended unless the hiding player shows no signs of planning to attack you.)Log on to an alt account.Join theBedwarslobby you are currently in. This can be found in the top left corner.You will be a spectator and have flying. Locate the hiding player. Please note that this could take a long time.Make sure to go back to your main account and shake your mouse quite often. Otherwise, you will time out and be disconnected, forcing you to leave the game and causing you to lose the game.Once you locate the hiding player, kill him.

If you are playing on PC or Mac through a browser, it might be annoying to crouch because if you try to crouch and move forward, a message will pop up about how CTRL+W deletes tabs. To fix this, simply click "Go full screen" or the F11 key, or use C to crouch.
If you have the ability, wait until there's no one at the enemies' base before you break the Bed. Try to be sneaky.
Before attacking other bases, if they have strong Bed defenses, you should prepare yourself with a Fireball, 3Moonstone Explosive, and a Stick. After breaking their Bed, try hitting the players with the Stick if they are next to the edge.
You can also rush with 3 or even 4 if your sweaty or good. You need to think tactically for this. It's crucial to be either a good PvPer or parkourist.
If you fall off and died in early game, you could quickly see others' bridging progresses. by looking up while falling. You can upper your render distance for better sight, although it may get a bit laggy.
The main issue of this game is that you lose all points upon death, while many griefers love griefing you on towers with a sniper (TAR-21or AWP). Taking cover will not work nowadays as you could see nametags through walls. Do your best at running around, trying to get kills. There is never the "best" Gun. You should find the best Gun that YOU could use.
Try every Gun. Unlock all Guns. Most people goes best with MP40 or a Double Barrel, but that may not be you. Quick running Guns such as M1911 could be extremely strong as well, so try all of them!
Griefers snipe you on sky bases. Try build you own on a further location when you have enough Blocks. When it gets invaded, abandon that. It is really hard to reclaim and get back up once you've fallen. Also, if you prefer killing on the ground then do take cover under roofs sometimes to avoid sky snipers. Buy powerups at a safe spot as this is your weak point.
Use a Pickaxe for melee fights. A Pickaxe is crucial if you get attacked while reloading or if you run out of ammo mid-fight.
Try out all the Kits and choose the one that fits you most. Kits of rarity Legendary aren't always the best! Think about what you're good at and choose the Kit that is specialized for that.
Something you will really need in Pirates are jumping skills. Due to a lot of Explosives, the ships and islands get a lot of holes through which you can fall and die. Knowing which jumps you can do and actually doing them is crucial for surviving.
If an enemy places a Moonstone Explosive on one of your spawns, shoot it with a Fireball. This will hit the explosive and move it away. It doesn't matter if you killed yourself or your team mates with this as long as the spawn is still there!
As with Pirates, choose the Kit that fits you most and not the rarest one in your collection. Some Kits could be considered scams or jokes regardless of their rarity (like Guardian).
A strategy is to rush to the middle where the best loot can be found. Equip yourself and wait till just a few players remain. Then try to kill them.This strategy can give you more wins but less kills.
The other strategy is in killing as many players as possible. You don't even need to go to the middle island in all maps. The problem is that you will be easily killed by others who went to the middle and have much better loot than you. This strategy yields less wins but more kills and more Coins.
Buying all Guns isn't recommended. It's just spending points while you mostly won't even need the Guns. If you are Veteran or Swordsman, this applies especially. If you are alone and hoarded by a lot of Zombies, no Gun can help you.
The main strategy in Infection is being a good team. One lone player needs to be extremely good to make any progress. This applies to Humans and Zombies.
The easiest way for Humans to win is by farming Zombie kills in a corridor. All maps have at least one good farming corridor near the start of the map. For optimal farming you need about half Humans and half Zombies. Humans stand at one end of the corridor and shoot the Zombies coming into the corridor at the other end. Humans are (almost) invincible at this. You will collect thousands of points in a matter of minutes. After everyone has a lot of points, just run. The Zombies won't catch up with you.
Not a lot of skill is needed to play Bloxd Hop like an average player. Just learn how to jump and sprint-jump.
Speedrunning Bloxd Hop is a different matter. You will need to be very precise when doing jumps. Learning toB-hopis recommended.

Buy Speed Boost
You should now be able to reach the gold block in 1 jump
Repeat Steps 3-4 until you have at least 270 coins
Buy Double Jump
Complete the parkour and reach the emerald block
Repeat Step 12 until you have at least 1200 coins
Buy Triple Jump
Repeat Step 12 until you have at least 3000 more Coins!
You are now rich (and have the ability to complete any map in less than 20 seconds)!
There are however some things to keep in mind:
Buy the jump and speed boosts in the level section to get a faster time.
Reset map time if it is about to run out.
After you are rich enough, try to get richer (such as 10000 coins) so you can start from Step 14 right away.
You can do the events to speed up getting coins
If you go toThis linkthen you can unlock a secret "Rewards" section in bloxdhop's shop. You can then watch an advertisement to get 30 free Gold Coins.
Bloxd Hop isn't just skill. Think about the jumps you will do. Discover which jumps are possible by trying it out.
Practice makes perfect. The most important thing at Bloxd Hop is practicing a lot.
A bit more of skill is needed to play Evil Tower. The maps are all different, but each separate floor is always the same. Learn each floor and you'll soon be able to complete the maps! Try practicing Bloxd Hop for a bit before starting with Evil Tower.
If you're not trying to speedrun but just want to reach the top, try crouching at the edges of Blocks and before Clay. You can also always use Boosts if you have enough money. Keep in mind that some Boosts , especially Speed, can mess you up if you're already very used to the usual jumping.
Seeing "compare number of mined blocks" is a problem in this game mode and these are the fastest ways to mine really fast.
Turn off chat to avoid being disturbed
Sub account required for faster mining
Use the right tools for the right block
Avoid AFK
Once you reach the Moon phase (the final phase) of the game mode, choose the easy phases (Plains, Volcano or Underground), avoid phases with wood or using a lot of tools or too many chests (Plenty, Desolation, Dungeon).
If you still have not made it to the portal, do not go. When you get bored after mining blocks on your One Block, you will get distracted and go to other's worlds instead of mining your own one block.
Put your Pickaxe, Axe, Shovel and Hoe on the first 4 hotbars
Left-Click to start mining
Continuously press 1, 2, 3 and 4 number Keys
This allows you to quickly switch to other Tools while mining so that you can use the tight tools for the right block
This trick works best with Diamond Tools so that you can mine fast
Using this with the Rainbow Phase works best as there are only 2 types of tools needed and they can be mined fast
You can also use Moonstone Tools but take note that even though you will mine faster, the Moonstone Pickaxe will give you the same block when mining so it may be a bit of a hassle re-mining the blocks to get Coal, Diamonds, Moonstone or Messy Stone
Learning how to bridge is an important thing to learn in the game. You will need it in a lot of gamemodes, and if you don't know how to do it, you really need how to learn to do it. It's required in lots of gamemodes like Skywars, Bedwars, and more! Here are the steps:
Get Blocks. A lot of Blocks. Get an appropiate  number of Blocks based on how long you want your bridge to be.
Before you bridge, you should be careful, the worst thing that could happen while you bridge is falling off, or getting killed while bridging. The best way is to pillar up or make stairs for your bridge. In Skywars, Pirates or Bedwars, it is good to make a staircase or pillar up before bridging. Never bridge to any place in Bloxd.io at ground level. Always get high before bridging. If you get attacked by Arrows,  Snowballs or Fireballs, etc, make a small wall on your bridge to block stuff like that. Then bridge while making walls.
Crouch by holding C on your keyboard or down arrow on mobile.
Turn around by moving your mouse to the right or left, dragging your finger on a trackpad to the right or left, or dragging your finger on your mobile screen (only do this on the middle-to right of your mobile screen to avoid moving your character)
Go to the edge of the Block you want to bridge from by moving back, but make sure you are still backwards.
With your bridging material selected look down and right-click (tap on mobile) the Block face that is facing in the direction you want to bridge in.
Repeat until the bridge is completed!
While crouching, it is almost impossible to fall off of your Block, you can fall only by jumping off, destroying the Block you are standing on, another player destroying your Block, or another player using a Tool to fling you off the bridge!
You can pillar up before bridging to avoid getting killed. To pillar, jump and place a Block before you land. Repeat until satisfaction.
To make a staircase, bridge a bridge two Blocks long, then jump and place a Block below you before landing, add another Block to the side, then jump and place. Repeat until satisfaction.
When playing faction mode, your number one goal is try to achieve a strong economy, and try to use one of the following method to farm materials to sell: mine at y=-86 to try to find diamonds and moonstones; Create a plot filled with saplings for lumbering; farm melons. These are the fast strategies to get a lot of gold.
NEVER let anyone teleport to you unless you have every diamond tools and is good in PVP or you know that's your friend. Otherwise, they will just kill you within their 10s immunity and take your stuff.
Building a base is also important. Make it very secret or get a protector.
Joining/creating factions are a much more minor thing for you if you are a party mode player(non-professional player). Just create a faction, get the protector, and throw a random base somewhere.
Always make your trade fast in Airship and crouch in it to hide your name tag, because players often hide there to kill others.
A really effective strategy in game is to warp to a market created by others. Check to see that no one of that faction is online, start a raid by pressing F, quickly break the chests containing valueable things (strength II potions, diamonds, gold, moonstone, etc.), end the raid, and go back to the market!
when building a base (especially in faction), consider the following:
first, your base's location should be ralatively hidden and far away from the spawn others and the 8 begginer camps in factions. Depending on your style, you have three types of good bases to choose:First, underground bases. The entrance should be as hidden as possible. For example find a river, go to the botton, and then pick a corner to dig down and build your base beneath.Note that never build your base too close to the bedrock layer, as people branch mining might accidentally run into it.Also, make sure your there is a layer of air between your base and the outer stones and use something like coal ores and iron ores to cover it so that people using x-ray texture packs packs wouldn't suspect a base there.Second, sky base. The sky base should be at least 130 blocks high so that even if players set their render distance to the highest, they still cant see your base without pillaring up.Third, on land bases. These bases are prone to raids in faction mode, but with proper defense and enough player in your faction, it is not a problem. Make sure there is an underground/sky section in your base though, just so that you still have somewhere to hide and store valuable things.

Structuresare groups of Blocks that are only naturally placed in a certain way. They can generate in different locations ofOpen Worlds. There are currently four types of structures in Bloxd.io, which are the: Mysterious Ruins, Lava Pools, Jungle Ruins and Frozen Ruins. They can be mainly found in open world game modes, likeSurvival,Peaceful,CreativeandFactions. There are extra preset structures inFactionswhich which are the shop, the camps, the Sand Mine and Wood Mill. However, they seem to be more of a utility instead of a naturally generated structure, similar to the work stations inGreenville.

Mysterious RuinsAll variations of ruinsInfoSpawns InPlains and forests (except cherry blossom forests)

Mysterious Ruins are mostly built out ofMessy Stone, Compressed Messy Stone variants and Stone Brick variants. Almost all Ruins haveVinesgrowing on them. Bigger Ruins also haveWoodand some even Patterned Glass. Loot Chests mostly containFood, SmeltedOres,Tools, Armorand building materials like Stone, Concrete or Ceramics. They do not contain Diamonds, Moonstone or Diamond Equipment like Armor, except in secret chests. All ruins haveMob Spawnerson them, all of them being hostile mob spawners.
The ruin have many varieties, which includes castles, churches, walls, statues, forts, colosseums and even normal ruins without ANY special loot.
Loot chests can contain anything from coal and bread to even diamond tools and armor. Some loot chests are even buried underground so be sure to bring a shovel along. Usually, the harder it is to find the chest, the better loot it contains.



Lava PoolA bugged Lava PoolInfoSpawns InAnywhere

Lava Pools are made out of Stone, Compressed Messy Stone, Magma and Lava. Sometimes, a Lava Pool might bug out and spawn without the solid Blocks, just Lava. They spawn in various shapes and sizes, usually adapting to the surrounding area
All lava pools are surrounded by Magma and Compressed messy stone.
Frozen Ruins are made out of many various blocks, but most haveStone Slabs,Messy Stone,Spruce Wood Planks,Spectral Log,Dirt, andSpawners. The Frozen Ruins contain aMob Spawner, which are all hostile. The chests containOres,Blocks, and variousTools, while both normal and secret chests found in the Skull Temples have a possibility of spawning Diamonds, Moonstone, and Diamond gear (Moonstone gear sometimes spawns).
There are multiple Frozen Ruin variations, some of which are gigantic, such as theSkull Temple, and some of which are small, such as agraveyard.There are two types of hut one with a spike trap and a small graveyard type thing in front with one spawner and a larger hut with 3 chests and one spawner. Some Frozen ruins also spawn likely to the normal ruins.
Ruins spawn in the Plains and ForestBiomes, but it'll be easier to find them in the Plains Biome since there's no Trees blocking your view. If you're in a Forest, climb up one of the Trees, or find a Mountain and then climb on top of it to find the Ruins!
Alternatively, you can also eat a watermelon and pillar up before gliding away.
While looting the Ruins and Frozen Ruins, always dig deep around the Ruins to make sure there are no remaining Loot Chests left. But also beware of your surroundings because many hostile mobs might spawn around and ambush you while you are digging.
When they were first added, Mysterious Ruins had no Loot Chests in them.
There is one 'hidden' Chest for each ruin type, containing the best loot.
The Bookshelves in the ruins used to be Full Bookshelves that could be obtained.
There's two ruin variations which are cathedrals.
One of the Ruins has aTribelogo on the back of it.
It is possible that Ruins can spawn buried underground or flooded by a waterform. Ruins and Lava Pools can also spawn on top of each other.
Traps can actually naturally spawn in one of the ruins.
Magma also naturally spawns in the same ruin.
Lava can spawn really deep touchingbedrock.
Some ruins have mineral blocks. For example, one flag in one of the ruins hides a moonstone block, while another fortress- / castle-like ruin has a diamond block hidden under a staircase.
The pillars found in Frozen Badlands occasionally contain Diamond ore
Magma can also naturally spawn in Frozen Ruins
The Frozen Ruins can be extremely glitched, some of which don't even contain a spawner. And some of them might have half of the structure buried.
There were also structures exclusive toFactions.

This will teleport you to the Spawn of the lobby. (Coordinates approximately 0 0 0). It's unadvised to go there if you're still weak because there will most probably be campers there waiting to kill you and take your Items.
Set a home. You can then teleport to this home any time you wish, unless damaged or attacked within 10 seconds. You can have a maximum of 3 homes at once. It is possible to delete a home and set it somewhere else, just make sure you won't need that home again.
Request teleport to a player. The player can accept or deny the request. If you see someone is requesting teleport to you, don't accept unless you know they are your friend or if you are ready to fight.
Create a Tribe. It costs 2 Iron Bars. You can invite players to your Tribe.
Once you have a Tribe you can:
Set a Tribe Home. This is a place where everyone from your Tribe will be able to teleport anytime.
Invite and remove players. A player must accept an invite to join the Tribe, but Tribe owner can always remove players.
Toggle members PvP. Decide whether you want members of your Tribe to be able to damage each other or not.
Disband Tribe. Delete the Tribe.
You can see who is a tribe member if there username is green that means they are in your tribe.
There are two types of Protectors in Survival which are:
These protect a Chunk (32 times 32 times 32 Blocks big cube). Only the person who placed the Protector can place and break Blocks and open Chests in the protected chunk. You can allow someone access to your Protectors and subsequently they can also break/place/open in the chunk. Remove their permission anytime.  A Protector is crafted with 1 Messy Stone and 2 Diamonds.Andesite, Granite or Dioritecan be used instead of Messy Stone. You can place a Maximum of 8 Protectors at once, even though you can craft as many as you wish.
These also protect a Chunk. Everyone in the Tribe can break and place Blocks and open Chests in a chunk protected with a Tribe Protector. Craft a Tribe Protector from 1 Stone and 2 Moonstone. Only Tribe owner can craft Tribe Protectors. A maximum of 4 Tribe Protectors can be placed at once.
Arthur made a system where you can unlock Protectors by breaking/placing Blocks.
There are certain things you should keep in mind when playing Survival!
If you don't visit a lobby for more than 30 days, your placed Protectors will disappear and everyone will be able to raid your bases.
Whenever a player with less than 80 HP and less than 10 seconds after being damaged leaves the game, they will be automatically killed by the game and their Items will be dropped. There will be this message displayed in chat:
[Player name] combat logged and was killed.
Blocks near spawn (in the range of 192 Blocks in all directions) will be reset every 150 minutes (2 and a half hours). Do not build your base there if you don't want to lose it, but there are some skybases in above the 192 block radius by building up in sky.
It is recommended not to "Quick Play", but to join lobbies with long digit names like for example "48675293" (Don't press Quick Play because it will join a crowded lobby, it will also make it harder for you to collect Items and easier to die.
Survival is one of the sandbox trio thatArthurmade, being the last to be added.
Survival is the default gamemode forWorldslobbies.
Gunshave been obtained in Survival with glitches.
There are Chainmail Armor and even odd flashy Armor on the second thumbnail (the one with a bunch of players in armor with a bunch of weapons and tools standing on a grassy cliff), making it obviously AI-generated.
Survival mode changed its thumbnail on May 1, 2024.Cube Warfarealso changed its thumbnail on the same day.
You can build up 1000 blocks and place blocks over spawn to avoid getting damaged, even when another mob hits you.First ThumbnailSecond ThumbnailCurrent Thumbnail
You Set Spawn Point (right click on a Bed), then you destroy theBed. If you die, you will be revived at Lobby Spawn.
You can watch an ad to get tools or armour up to iron level. However, do it in a safe place, as you will not be able to control your character, so if a player or a mob is fighting you, you will not be able to fight back or run until the ad is over, which takes 5 seconds.

There is a world barrier 400 blocks away that stops players from going too far or too high, inside which is the survival area in cuboid shape. If players pass the barrier, they will be poisoned until they return to the survival area. The survival area starts to shrink after 11 minutes, when you see a message saying that the border is shrinking. It shrinks as time elapses, until the barrier is only 24 blocks away from the center of the world. The bottom of the barrier is as low as the bedrock layer (y=-99), so it is safe to stay underground. After an update the barrier would only appear if a player was X blocks away (close enough/render distance?)
When the game begins there is a small display at the right showing how many players are still alive. It also shows when the survival zone will start shrinking, and when it does shrink, how many blocks from spawn it is.
Players are also given acompassthat shows the nearest player whilst giving their name. If you hover over the compass, it will also tell you the nearest player alive while warning you that the compass only detects players 15 blocks away. If this player is above or below you, thecompasscan also tell you whether the player tracked is above or below. Before, the compass used to point to spectators, and drop upon death in the new updates. Now, compasses no longer point to spectators and don't drop upon death. If you craft a compass, the compass will also point to the nearest player. The compass also works when held, showing this as its item name when held:
Nearest Player [PlayerName?] [Above/Below]
In the first two minutes of the game, there is a grace period meant for resource gathering. During this time, players cannot attack each other.
Upon killing a player, all items (except their compass) will be dropped.
Below is a list of kits:
In the thumbnail for Survival Royale, we get to seeDirty Flea SackandArthurat the world border. It is weird thatArthuris fighting with a Ironpickaxewith Iron Helmet, but Dirty Flea Sack is somehow fighting without armour but with a diamond sword.
The font used in the nametags in the thumbnail are monospace fonts which the default text of the game isn't.
It was rumoured that it is impossible to getDiamondsin the game mode, which is false. They were just really hard to get, since after mining the world border would close in and because of being in an enclosed area (strip-mine) you would die really easily.
Survival Royale is agamemodethat uses the openworldand has the same seeds asSurvivalandPeaceful(but not creative).
Survival Royale was the gamemode with the highest lobby capacity, having 50 players per game.

Swordsare a weapon that is primarily used in Mob hunting and PvP. They have the most damage of all weapons, but it also deals significantly less damage than all other armors to balance it out, though its damage can be increased with the Stone Sword, Iron Sword, Gold Sword, Diamond Sword, or Knight Sword.

Grass Slabs can be crafted by the four with anArtisan Benchfrom 2 Grass Blocks, their purpose being as a decoration for ground in builds.
Pine Grass Block
Grass
Pine Grass Blocks are a variant of Grass Blocks found in Pine Forests.
Grass appear as a transparent block in the form of Grass, Tall Grass, Pine Grass, or Spectral Grass, and can be obtained with shears.
Grass appears in every biome that grass is in and is extremely plentiful in grassy plains and meadows. It has no crafting recipes as it is simply decorative.
Tall Grass
Tall Grass was the original name for the regular grass, but in an update, tall grass is now a 2 block tall version of grass that spawns in all biomes grass spawns in, and like grass, is decorative.
Pine Grass
Pine Grass is a variant of Grass appearing in Pine Forests instead of Grass. Like Grass, it cannot be crafted, serving a simply decorative purpose.
Spectral Grass
Spectral Grass one of the shortest blocks, only just taller thenCarpets, which are 1 pixel tall, as it stands 2 pixels tall. It can be found inFrozen Badlandsand Spectral Forests, and, like all grass variants, is decorative.
Grassy Plains
Grass appears in 10 biomes including: Maple Forests, Plum Forests, Aspen Forests, Pear Forests, Cherry Blossom Forests, Bluebell Forests, Plains, Hilly Plains, Jungles, Autumn Forests, Meadows, and Grassy Plains.
Spectral Grass appears in Frozen Badlands and Spectral Forests.
Pine Grass appears in Pine Forests.
When Tall Grass was the name for regular grass, the grass block was simply called "Grass"

Terrain Generationis the way that Bloxd.io generates terrain in theOpen World Gamemodes.
1Structure1.1Underground1.2Above-Ground (Mountains)
1.1Underground
1.2Above-Ground (Mountains)
2Biomes
3Water forms
A normal Bloxd.io world is divided into severalBiomesthat appear on the surface of the Bloxd.io world. This is the area where players will spawn in most lobbies unless the spawn point has been changed manually.
The surface of theBloxd.ioworld mostly containsNatural Soilslike Dirt, Sand and Snow.
Below the layer where Natural Soils spawn, different types ofstonesgenerate instead. This layer may containOresand valuable minerals. This layer stretches from approximately y= -5 ~ -21 to y= -99.
y= -100 is whereBedrockspawns. InSurvivalandPeaceful, it is impossible to dig further down from this point due to Bedrock being indestructible, but there after the Bedrock layer, stones still generate, butOresdo not.
Beyond the Bedrock layer, stones like Stone, Andesite, Diorite and Granite can still spawn until y= -130. This area has been nicknamed the “Understone”. Ores cannot spawn here, but small caves rarely can.
Beyond the Understone is the Void. It is an endless stretch of empty space and it occupies the y-levels y= -131 and beyond. Lobby Owners ofWorldscan set a death height below -100.
There are two different types of “hilly terrain”: mountain ranges and hills.
Hills are mound-shaped formations ofstonesandNatural Soilsthat are higher than normal terrain. Their highest peaks are normally at y=30.
Mountain ranges are very tall as they can stretch up to approximately y=100. The tallest ever found is at y=110, but anything above y=95 is very rare. They are massive ring-shaped formations ofStoneandSnowthat shoot up from the ground. Other Natural Soils can only generate up to y=60, and if a mountain range is bordering a Desert, (a usually low-lying Biome,) Canyons will generate to blend in the Desert and the mountain range. AllDirtthat generates above y=54 will become Rocky Dirt.
Snowgenerates from y=80 and up.
Most surface terrain generation is split intoBiomes. Note that biomes do not blend with each other, so a relatively “cold” biome may border a relatively “hot” one.
The Canyon biome generates only if a Desert is bordering a mountain range.
Water generates naturally on the Bloxd.io world in two forms: lakes and rivers.
When in a Snowy Plains biome, the tops of waterforms turn to Ice.
Lakes are large pools of water while rivers are long, and shallower compared to lakes.

It is said thatDirtyFleaSackcreated the game mode (due to him making the mobs update).

A texture pack is a folder that changes the in-world look ofBlocks, sky,Itemsin yourInventory, and even models of entities and models of other blocks that were previously unchangeable.
Oliver has made a site for people/ user’s who wanted to create a texture pack but don’t  know how to make one:https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs

Current Bloxd.io Block Texture Pack (original, will change every new block update):https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packsis there for if you are confused about what name should be there)
These are popular texture packs you can use directly from the settings, without really using folders. Just click on the right button and apply it, then refresh your page (it will pop up a screen where you can just click on "Refresh Page" and then rejoin the game).
Below are the steps of how to use a texture pack.
Go to abloxd.io, press [O] or open the settings menu, go to "Texture pack" , press one of the texture packs or if you have a customized texture pack, press custom and drop a Texture pack folder. If you are on mobile, click on the cog in the top and click on the texture pack section, select "Custom" and upload your file, if you are on IOS you can drag and drop your file. But a lot of mobile players can’t use texture packs…
Press "Apply" and reload your page.
Hereis a link to a documentation on how to make a Texture Pack.
A Texture Pack is a folder with images which overwrite those in the game. Below is a structure of a texture pack folder.
└── 📁<texturePackName>└── 📁textures└── <textureName>.png└── 📁skyBoxes└── 📁<skyBoxName>└── nx.jpg└── ny.jpg└── nz.jpg└── nz.jpg└── px.jpg└── py.jpg└── pz.jpg└── 📁models└── <modelName>.glb
Textures are how blocks and items look in bloxd.io
To change your textures, create a folder named textures under your texture pack folder and add png images to the textures folder that has the same name as one of the textures names.
Below is a list of available texture names and what block or item they change (if it's not loading go tohttps://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs, they will fix it soon)
Models only support .glb (you can make GLB models onBlockbenchand Blender)
A skybox is how you can change how the sky looks inbloxd.io.
To customize your skybox, create a new folder under your texture pack folder named skyBoxes and under that folder, create a folder in the skyboxes folder that has the same name as one of the available skyboxes below.
(All gamemodes on bloxd only use the default skybox, except for BloxdHop, Lucky Towers, and Rocket Spleef which are the only games that use the other ones.)
Then, add six png or jpg images to the skyBoxes folder with the same names below.
Just knowing which link goes where isn't enough. You must also take care of the images being oriented in the right way when uploading them to Imgur or otherwise using them. Only if the images are oriented in the right way will they fit together nicely. Here is a reference on the correct orientation. Each image has four sides. This will tell you which side of each image will touch which side of the other images and how it must be turned.
When uploading the images, some of them may look to be turned upside down or rotated for 90 degrees. Don't worry about that as long as you turned them in the way shown by the reference above. The game will then create the right sky.
Easiest way to do this is by first uploading one image and then turning the other images so they follow the reference.
Bloxd Packer

Go into the settings
Click "Texture Pack"
Open a new tab
Hover your mouse over the information symbol on theBloxd.iotab, then copy the link over to the new tab and go to the site. (Or, if you want to save time, just go tohttps://i.imgur.com/oc70r8J.pnginstead; we did the work for you.)
Right-click the line (that is the originalBloxd.ioTexture Pack)
Click "Save Image As."
Open the image in an image editor (MS Paint Online, Pixlr, or Piskel are all good image editors that are free)
Make the edits you want to make to the texture pack, then save.
Go to piskel, then when importing, set to spritesheet and tell it what texture you're making. If you're making an 8 x 8, put 8 in both boxes of the set to spritesheet option. If you're making a 16x16, put 16 in both boxes of the spritesheet option.
Now download each one and name it, a guide to naming it will be available to you -->https://github.com/Bloxdy/texture-packs
Put all the images in a new folder called "textures"
Go to settings (top right corner gear icon if you're mobile somehow) and then go to texture packs and hit custom

Before texture packs became jsons and folders, you couldn't modify models of items.

BridgeInfoDescriptionA 2v2 game. Jump into the other player's hole to win!Developer(TBC)
During theDuelsvsHide and SeekGamemode Vote,The Bridgewas a sub gamemode for Duels. On 10 October 2024,The Bridgewas re-released as a limited time gamemode. Later it became a permanent gamemode and was renamed toBridge.
1Bridge (Current Version)
2The Bridge-Old Version2.1Starting Inventory
2.1Starting Inventory
3Trivia
Bridgeis a gamemode where you have to score 3 points by falling into the enemies' hole. Each of the two teams has a starter base, these bases are connected by a one Block wide bridge. You spawn with red or blue WoodArmordepending on which team you are playing for and try to reach the enemy base to earn a point for your team. Your starting Inventory contains: 1Iron Swordto fight your opponents, 64Concretein the colour of your team (Red or Blue),  1 Iron Pickaxe to mine the opponent's Concrete defense and 1 Bread to heal yourself. At the center of the bridge is a WhiteBaked СlayBlock - this is where the colour changes.
Your base is a small building with a hole in the middle. There are two ways to access the hole: by entering the hole from the inside and jumping in from the roof. When in a game it is important toBlockthese areas. You cannot build in the base.
Instead of 3, players needed to score 5 points to win.
InDuels, players start the match with the following items:
Iron Sword
64 Red/Blue Concrete
Iron Pickaxe
Bread
999 Messy Stone
Red/Blue Wood Chestplate, Gauntlets, Leggings, and Boots
For some reason,Armorin Bridge did not include theHelmet.
Before the game begins in Bridge, players are trapped in a Glass box for 5 seconds.
There used to be a bug in Bridge where spectators could jump into the hole and score.
This gamemode has the lowest amount of players to make the lobby full to start the game, which being 2-4 players.
Use bunny hop to score inside the opponent’s box to score points quicker.

The PitInfoDescriptionJump into the pit, beat everyone else!DeveloperMattzap
The Pitis an exhilarating game mode set within an expansiveplayer-versus-player (PvP)arena featuring a vibrant mushroom theme, characterized by the distinctive use of red mushroom blocks. In this dynamic environment, players leap into a central pit, equipped with essential weaponry, namely an iron sword and an iron bow, along with a supply of 15 arrows. Initially, players utilized Reinforced pebbles in place of the bows and arrows; however, with the recent update implemented by Arthur, these have been upgraded to the new bow and arrow items.
Each participant enters the arena with a standard set of armor, including an iron chestplate, wooden gauntlets, iron leggings, and wooden boots, providing a balanced defense in the heat of battle. Additionally, players have the opportunity to enhance their armor through various upgrades available in the shop.
The objective ofThe Pitis to survive against competitors by eliminating them, which rewards players with coins andXP. The accumulated coins can be spent on temporary upgrades or permanent perks, whileXPcan be used to unlock these perks, enhancing a player's abilities in future matches. However, it’s worth noting that The Pit was ultimately overshadowed by the popularity of theMurder Mysterymode during game mode voting.
The top of the pit is a safe place wherePvPis disabled. Players spawn here when they die or when they join the game. This is the only area where you can access the shop. Press [B] to access the shop.
Press [B] to get to the shop where you can buy these things. This is the list of the things you can buy:
You could throw aMoonstone Orbinto the safe haven, or you could useObsidianBlocks to tower up into the safe haven.
There are multiple ways to enter the pit, like exiting from the sides. This gives you less players to deal with.
You lose all your items upon dying, and you get the defaultitems.
The Pit used to have Reinforced Pebbles but were then replaced with Iron Bows (With Arrows of course).
Through a Link, The Pit was still playable for three days after it was removed.
The players in the thumbnail all have the same name.
The Pit's Map is actually a Minecraft Map built by someone else and not any of the devs themselves

The Update Log, is a very valuable resource for players seeking to stay informed about the latest developments and modifications to the game, was introduced to Bloxd.io on August 14, 2024.
As its name implies, the Update Log serves as a comprehensive record of recent changes, updates, and additions to the game, providing users with a transparent and easily accessible means of staying up-to-date on the latest happenings.
The incorporation of the Update Log was a key component of a broader update to the game's homepage user interface, which saw the prominent Discord logo replaced by a more streamlined and functional layout. This revised design featured conveniently located buttons that granted users quick access to essential information about the game, the Update Log itself, and the Discord community. The design was revised again, with the Update Log now found in the Settings menu.
Furthermore- the Update Log has been designed with a user-friendly feature that automatically opens the log when a player launches the game, but only if new game modes, features, or other significant updates have been implemented since their last session. This thoughtful touch ensures that players are always aware of the latest changes and can immediately explore the new content, fostering a sense of excitement and discovery within the community. By providing a clear and concise record of updates, the Update Log has become an indispensable tool for players seeking to maximize their gaming experience and stay engaged with the evolving world of Bloxd!
The update log can be found in corner of the Bloxd.io homepage.

Uh oh - Draugr Skeletons are here to cause more chaos in caves! They drop Bones, which can be used to craft Bone Meal - use this to grow your crops faster. Approach them with caution though, since they almost never miss! (If they accidentally hit a Cave Golem or Draugr Zombie, expect a crazy brawl to break out...)
Fed up of using Code Blocks to spawn mobs? Now you can use mob spawner blocks! These blocks will spawn mobs of your choice when placed. They haven't made their way into the Mysterious Ruins yet, but don't worry, they'll be there soon!
Mob Spawners have been added to Ruins! They've been carefully placed to induce maximum rage, so prepare yourself to get shoot off tall ledges by Draugr Skeletons at least 10 times.... (Hopefully the loot will make it worthwhile!)

Hostile mobs have made their way to the surface... and they've brought a new biome with them- the Frozen Badlands! Explore this new biome to find a new tree type, new blocks, and new mobs. Pay special attention to the Draugr Knight, which will now spawn deep in caves too. Knights are the apex predator of Bloxd - they're fast, agile and carry a Diamond Sword. They're absolutely vicious, but if manage to conquer in combat, you'll get a Diamond Fragment for your troubles. Good luck! (You'll need it...)
Bloxd.io has landed on the Play Store! Download it by clicking the button below or searching io.bloxd.play on the Play Store! Please leave us a review if you enjoy playing bloxd!
We will be releasing on he Apple App Store soon!

Wolves, Bears, Deer and Stags have all appeared in the new and improved Pine Forests! You can tame Wolves using Bones, and they'll defend you loyally to the death. They'll also persist between play sessions, so no need to worry about losing your pets while you're offline.  Bears and Stags may seem cute., but careful - they're pretty territorial! Pine trees also have a new look, and you can find new flora on the forest floor. We've also heared rumours of a mythical beast that roams these forests, but we haven't seen one yet... Maybe you can find them? Send us a screenshot if you do!
An Enchanting Update is here! You can now enchant tools, bows and... sticks?? Also, Aura XP Orbs and Potions have also been added to the game. Find orbs randomly when grinding for Aura and use them to craft these new potions! They can also be found in the creative menu.
Salvage your unwanted tools and armour to convert them back into resources. Salvage your materials into Aura Fragments if you don't need them anymore.
A bunch of new items have just been dropped! Draugr Knights now carry a new sword - it's more powerful than a Diamond Sword, and it has knockback too! Golems now drop Golem Eyes, which can be used to craft a Golem Pickaxe. This special pickaxe has a chance to drop Moonstone Fragments while mining ores. Fur can now be used to craft Spiked Boots that do stomp damage when falling on enemies, and a Fur Chestplate that reduces knockback. And there's more to come! What unique items would you like us to add next? Let us know!

An update for the builders out there. This update adds a decorative chalk block (find it at the bottom of the rivers). Color it for some juicy pastel colors, and craft it for some bricks! Complete with equivalent slabs.
Two new Bedwars Trios/Squads Maps - Rooftops and Tavern. Thanks to those who participated in the beta test, your feedback was super helpful! More Solos/Duos maps coming soon!
You can now sleep on beds! Curl up on a Leaf Bed, Wool Bed, or Strong Bed to get some rest. When you wake pick a perk; the longer the perk stays around!
Jungle Biomes can now be found in bloxd.io! Explore the dense foliage to find jungle ruins, mango trees, wildcats and gorillas! You can tame wildcats with meat, and they’ll get the zoomies if you feed them a very special plant… The gorilla may look friendly, but don’t underestimate them! They’re pretty strong, they’ll throw your way if you get too close, if defeated, they’ll drop bananas.
New Rocket Obby map! It’s a bit harder than the original map, try it now!
Bloxd.io has landed in the Apple App Store! Download it by clicking the button below it or searching bloxd.io on the Apple App Store. Please leave us a review if you enjoy playing bloxd!
Try the new Bedwars map: Siege!
You can now promote (and demote) players in your custom lobbies! Co-Owners can use World Builder, edit Code Blocks and manage other world settings. Moderators can kick, ban and unban players. More custom-lobby upgrades coming soon!
Interestingly, the players in entry 4 and 76 do not have nametags.
One of the update log entries was actually a April Fool’s joke. It was very clear.
The images of entries 3 and 4 are the thumbnails of Rocket Spleef and Rush Racing respectively.
MangoWoodis currently the most recent wood type since SpectralWood.
The picture on Update Log entry 10 (Friend System update) has 2 players, in which the 2 names are Oliver and ExaltedToasterino (from left to right) In which the name ExaltedToasterino is the strange name because it is not one of the official names added in the same year because it does not have a number at the end of the name. ExaltedToasterino appears in later images too. He could be Oliver's friend.
In Update Log entry 14 (the update entry that announces the adding of structures), in update log No. 19 (the update entry that announces the adding of chests to buildings), new variations have been added to the structures and they have been expanded. The chests contain Iron and/or Food.
In Update Log entry 17 (the update entry that announces Bedwars Solos' return), the thumbnail has changed to a green Bed with the number 1, similar to the other 3 Bedwars game modes Duos, Trios and Squads. (formerly Teams)
In the image of Update Log entry 20, a player with Dirty Flea Sack's name is visible through the Corn plants.
In the image of Update Log entry 23, it is clear that it was edited, making that the first edited picture used in the Update Log.
In the image of Update Log entry 24, the image was took in the same location where Update Log entry 23's image was took.
The official first Mobs in the game werePigsandCows, even though theIron Watermelonis regarded as a Mob.Pigswere added on November 11th, 2024, whileCowswere added on November 29th, 2024.
Update Log entry 9 is the last update log that the former developer Stardue created and this is one of her last achievements before leaving. Stardue was a co-developer during the early days of Bloxd.
Update Log entry 32 is considered a major update for Worlds.
Update Log entries 22 and 39 are the only two update log entries that contain an emoji in their name.
The Moonstone Axe chops down a maximum of 7 Wood Items above the Wood Item chopped.
The Chat UI was changed in the update recorded in Update Log entry 39.
The mobs in entry log 49 have a name called "Smart Mob". This does not appear in real gameplay.
The description of Update Log 51 (Bedwars update) has an "*" in the date, being "24/02*/2025". It has since been fixed to "24/02/2025".
The "Mythical Mob" in the wildlife update was the "Gold Watermelon Stag".
Strangely, in entry log 72, the color for the new armour is maroon color instead of brown. This is because the texture taken for this picture was contrasted/saturated.

A username is a name to identify certain individuals on bloxd. a username can be changed by clicking the current username in the top left corner. To prevent identity theft, only 1 Bloxd.io account can claim a name, whereas many people attempt to bypass by spamming underscores (e.g _____Arthur_____). Bloxd usernames cannot contain profanity. Be careful when switching to a different username temporarily. People could "steal" your old username to troll you or to impersonate you.
You are encouraged to log in with a Google account to save your name and progress. If you log in, the Login icon next to the username will be replaced by a Bloxd character head.
How your name is displayed when you are logged in.
There is also a random username option, which gives you a random default username made out of an adjective followed by a noun and 7 numbers.
The default usernames are given to any new rookie opening Bloxd and they are two words followed up with numbers (e.g FranticVampire3543022). The ones inboldare rare default names. The ones initalic(in the "Old Usernames" section) are newer names that were added on to the single-word name scheme later on. Default usernames can be:

You can find a photo of the game at thebackground. It is changed randomly, or ifArthurwants it to.
As of currently, there are only four Background images. They are builds made by known Bloxd players. (Not including differentversions. The background images of different versions can be foundhere) Note that the background images are blurred.
On the 14th of August 2024, the update Log was added. You can access through a button in the bottom left corner. There you will find the latest updates to Bloxd. This is good for Bloxd players who haven't joined the Bloxd Discord server or don't check the dev-log there. The Update Log works like a timeline, starting with the addition of the Update Log.
The update log as of 5 September, 2024
The Update Log was added on 14 August 2024. As the name suggests, the Update Log is used to keep track of recent changes for the players to see. The Update Log was added as a part of a very minor homepage change, which replaced the large Discord Logo with the buttons for the information, the Update Log and the Discord.
For more information and entries, Clickhere.
On the right side of the menu there is a panel that allows you to add friends in Bloxd.io. Send a friend request to a user by typing in their username in the search. Once you receive a friend request, you can choose either accept or deny. The friends list displays whether your friends are online or not. If they are, you can join the lobby they are playing.
In the top right corner are the Options. They are the same as if you press [O], with an additional separate setting for music volume, other in-game sound volume and full screen mode.

2Trivia
Void was a halloween jokeArthurmade. It used to stalk the player if no one was in a 15-block radius. But sometimes it would hack players computers.
Void is a mob that has apparently been banished to the illegal lobbies Survival -1 and Creative -1. It has been banished there by the creators of the game, after it was apparently destroying servers. Many YouTubers have made videos about this, including SudiFromYT. He talked about the mob and where it is. He even went to the lobby.
Void can be found in Survival -1 and Creative -1. To get here, you must go to the URL at the top of your screen and change the number from whatever lobby you're playing to -1. This would be easiest if you were in Creative or Survival. When you get to the lobby, you may see various black lines across the ground. These may be from a player or Void. The -1 lobby is unavailable in bloxd.io 2.0.
The Void is like Minecraft. When you fall into it, you will die. The owner of a lobby can change the void death height. the void height has to be less or equals y-100 It is impossible to survive long in the void. In parkour lobbies, building the parkour in the void is popular, so if players fall they don't fall onto the regular world. Unlike Minecraft, you lose all of your hearts when you reach the Void death height.
Void's other name is Bloxd_Entity_09.

WallsInfoDescriptionPrepare with your team before the wall comes down and you need to fight to the death!DeveloperOliver

Walls is limited-timeGamemodeoriginally added on November 20, 2023, and was temporarily removed one day later. It is mostly a PvP game mode where 4 teams fight to the death after 5 minutes of resource gathering. On April 5, Walls officially lost againstInfectionin the game mode vote. Then on May 29, 2024, it was added back again againstBingoonStaging, and on May 31, 2024 onBloxd.io. On June 7, 2024, it was removed along withBingoandAnarchy, forever.
Note: Walls hasn't been available for a long period of time and not much information could be gathered, it's also a possibility that some of the information written here is inaccurate or incomplete.

1.2Underground
2Gameplay
3Trivia
There are two different maps in Walls. One is made of Sandstone buildings in a desert, the other one resembles medieval castles. Both maps are made out of 4 compartments which are separated by walls. Each team starts in it's own compartment. There is another narrower compartment in the shape of a "+"  formed by the walls which can only be accessed after the walls fall. Both maps have an underground rich withOres. The underground parts are also separated byBedrock.
On the surface, there are some buildings and a few lootChestsplaced around the map. You can get someWeapons,Food,ToolsandPotionsin the Chests. The Chests don't refill. After the walls fall, you can get to other compartments and kill enemies or access the last and richest Chest situated at the very middle of the map.
The underground can be accessed very easily from the surface by breaking a few Blocks (Wood) blocking the entrance. It's not as deep as the usual underground in OpenWorldsand the Ores aren't based on coordinates. This means you can find all Ores (Coal, Iron, Gold and Diamond) everywhere throughout the mine. Still Diamonds are rarer than Gold which is rarer than Iron. Moonstone can't be found. The position of Ores in the mines isn't generated randomly, meaning you can memorize where Diamonds are situated. The underground sections are separated from each other by Bedrock walls, however, these barriers don't fall when the walls on the surface do. Many players decide to hide in the mines (not recommended) or get stuck in them.
When the game starts, all players are sorted into 4 teams (Red, Blue, Yellow and Green). You get aWood Helmetin the colour of your team. Loot the Chests and quickly go mining to makeArmorand aDiamond Sword.Be careful not to waste your Diamonds/Gold Bars on a Helmet as it will be un-equipable. This so other players can always see which team you are in. When 5 minutes run out, you can attack other teams. Make sure you check out Chests in other teams' compartments as they will most likely still have some Items in them. The team with the last player(s) standing wins. There are no rewards, Coins, Kits or Experience levels in Walls.
Before 29 May 2024, the game description had a typo. It read," Prepare with your team beforethenwall comes down and you need to fight to the death!" The word "then" was replaced with "the".
You can tower up only to a certain height, after that height, the Blocks placed disappear and a message pop out saying: "You can't build inside bases", which is a message from theBedwarsgame mode when you try to place a Block inside a base.
The height limit can be exceeded with aMoonstone Explosivecannon,fireballingyourself, or using aladder launcher.
The player starts with a Wood Helmet dyed with the color of his team.
On 3 April 2024, a beta release was made, which showsInfectionwinning the game mode vote against Walls.
Soon after the gamemode vote started, a new map was added to Walls.
The gamemode picture used to be different and looked like it was generated by AI.

A Pumpkin
Pumpkins can be used to make Pumpkin Pie, which, when eaten, gives 16 Seconds of Damage.
Carved Pumpkins can be Created Simply with 1 Pumpkin on an Artisan without any other items.
Jack-o-Lanterns can be created on an artisan bench with 1 Carved Pumpkin and 1 Coal.
A Watermelon
Watermelons can be crafted into 4 Watermelon Slices Which then can be turn into Gold Watermelon Slices with a Gold Bar.
Watermelon Slices are eaten to give a Jump Boost for 12 Seconds.
Gold Watermelon Slices are eaten to give Jump Boost for 18 Seconds
A Melon
Like Watermelons, Melons can be crafted into 4 Melon Slices Which then can be turn into Gold Melon Slices with a Gold Bar.
Melon Slices are eaten to make the player invisible for 12 Seconds.
Gold Melon Slices are eaten to make the player invisible for 18 Seconds
An Iron Watermelon
TheIron Watermelonhas an extremely small chance of spawning instead of a Watermelon when it grows, and can be crafted into 128 Iron Bars.
We still don't know the chance for an Iron Watermelon to grow, but it is speculated to be about 1 in 10000 chance of a Watermelon to spawn as an Iron Watermelon.
The Iron Watermelon is supposedly the first mob to be added as it would jumpscare you if you were to far away from it, but this feature was removed, and the Iron Watermelon Block still remains in the game.
Juicy Growable is the name given to Pumpkins, Watermelons, and Melons in Factions

Arthuris the creator ofBloxd.io. He is from the United Kingdom. Arthur once worked for Microsoft. When he found out that Microsoft was buying Minecraft, he quit the company and created his own game based on Minecraft. Arthur created the game engine via Noa (a free and open source game engine). Ayaan, an unknown coder, also helped Arthur on the development of the game.
The first game made with the Bloxd.io game engine wasBloxd Hop(formerly know as BloxdHop) byWeiqing. Arthur is friends with Mattzap. Arthur has also created over 15gamemodesforBloxd. He writes the updates he rolls out toBloxdon its Discord Server in the #dev-log channel in theBloxd Discord Server.
Dirty Flea Sack leaked how Arthur chooses new devs (starting from Stardue).
The “dev” (still unofficial) makes a game mode, it was added to a game as a lonely LTM for a few hours.
Arthur looks at the feedback of the game mode.
The “dev” soon creates another game mode, and it gets in a vote with the old one.
Then the dev becomes official.

Weiqingwas the initial developer ofBloxd Hop.Arthurfirst started working onBloxd.ioand then invited Weiqing to make Bloxd Hop using the Bloxd game engine. Bloxd Hop was the first publicly available bloxd.io game, dubbing Weiqing as one of the first creators of the game.
Weiqing and Arthur probably made the first game modeBloxd Hoptogether. Arthur gave Weiqing authority over Bloxd Hop, and Arthur worked behind the scenes making the bloxd game engine. After a while, Arthur took over development ofBloxd Hop, fixing bugs and keeping it up to date with the rest of the bloxd game engine.MattzapMattzap's Discord profile picture.GamemodesOne Block,Greenville,Murder Mystery,The Pit
Mattzapis a friend ofArthur. He was the 3rd developer ofBloxd.io. He created fourgamemodesas of  but now he works on a game that he created called "mageclash.io". Mattzapp normally createdLimited Time Modes.

--- Page 322: https://bloxd-io.fandom.com/wiki/Wildcat ---
The Wildcat is a neutral mob added to the Jungle Biome update on: 7/3/25. It shares almost the same characteristics with another mob theWolf. It’s also the 5th mob to give out an effect, which is Weakness!
WildcatInformationHealth80BehaviorNeutralSpawns inJungleDamage (no armor)10-12 (gives Weakness)

The Wildcat has many variants of itself, of being the 7th mob to have different variants. It might be an ocelot, black cat, Maine coon, orange, semi gray-white, orange-black-white, and one with dark brown stripes.
The Wildcat can be tamed just like a wolf can. They can have an adjective name and a collar as a cosmetic. You can view all the possible names we possibly found so farhere(this directs to the Wolf page).
The Wildcat still has the same problem with the wolf (the wolf was patched); when you hit a tamed cat, the other tamed cat will attack it. (Also its fixed)
When you feed it with Catnip, it gives them damage and speed boost. This only works for a tamed Wildcat.
The Wildcat is the second neutral mob in Bloxd. The other neutral mob is theWolf.

Wolvescan have many skin variants; their number of skin variants is 4th afterCow,⁣⁣Draugr⁣⁣,andFrostZombies. Brown, grey, dark brown, orange, black, or dark blue skin. There is also a variant of wolf that is blue-gray with blue-green (aquamarine) spots, which resembles theSpectral Tree's colorpalette. This mob has five skin variants.
They mainly just wander around randomly. But if a player or mob hits them, they will attack the said player or mob.
Taming a wolf can be done by just simply right-clicking on it with a bone a few times until red hearts pop up around the wolf, similar to Minecraft.
They will follow the player wherever they go. They will also continuously teleport to the player. The tamed wolf will always defend the tamer. If the tamer hits another player or mob or gets hit, they will attack said entity for the tamer. If there are none, the wolf returns to the tamer. You only can tame up to of 3 wolves and if you try to tame more, you will receive the message "Can't tame more than 3 mobs". Cosmetically, tamed wolves have a collar around their neck.
In the early days of Wolf development, after taming Wolf, you could only restore HP to Wolf with Steak, so your first task before taming them was to kill cows and get coal ore in order to make Steak. But now you can restore them with raw food like Raw Beef and it applies to all other meats! So there is no need to get coal ore anymore!
You will get 0.3 Aura XP after killing a Wolf. But not any items though.
Wolves are named as "[adjectiveWolf]." These are named after the first name of a new player who hasn’t chosen his/her username (for example:ElegantNomad3061896.) The first name is selected for the wolf.

It will help you attack all mobs that it hits you or you hit it.
It only eats raw meat, rotten meat. So when you kill a meat mob (Pig,Cow,Sheep,Deer,Draugr/Frost Zombie), feed it if it has low HP.
When taming 2 or 3 wolves, if you hit one of them, the others will gather to "bully" that dog.
Previously, Wolf could only be healed with Steak.
When one of the wolves attacks another person, it will not follow you. If it attacks another mob, it may still attack another person.
It lives in Pine Forests. It takes a few minutes to spawn.
The Wolf is the first neutral mob in Bloxd.io.
They can be healed with all kinds of meat cooked or even raw!.
They spawn naturally in Pine Forests.
They don’t get poison from zombie flesh.
As of 5/21/2025, if there are 2 or 3 wolves and the tamer hits one, the wolves don't fight the said wolf.

Leavesare found on top of the tree, serving the decorative purpose. Leaves have crafting recipes of their own. When you mine tree-grown Leaves, it will either drop the Leaves block or drop a Sapling respective to the Tree type or the fruit respective to the Tree type. Player-placed Leaves will always drop themselves. SeeFoodpage for more information about fruits. The average tree drops between 40-50 leaves.
Leaves can be used for decoration. As one of the easiest to obtainBlocksare very handyBlocksthat can be used for emergency shelters, handy blocks or forbridging.
There were a few crafts with Leaves. Now there are even less, due to most of them being replaced by cotton.
Barkless Logs are mainly used for decoration. They can be obtained by using right-click or [E] on a Log with anAxeto get a Barkless Log. Barkless logs were previouslyIllegal Items.

Woolis a Block that is crafted from Cotton and can be dyed in any of the sixteen different colors. It can be used as a crafting material for Beds and Carpets or as a Building Block.
Woolcan be dyed (viaArtisan Bench) in sixteen colors, which are White, Orange, Magenta, Light blue, Yellow, Lime, Pink, Gray, Light gray, Cyan, Purple, Blue, Brown, Green, Red, and Black using flowers and plants. Unlike Colored Glass, Concrete, and Baked Clay, the white variant serves as the undyed Block. Wool is weak and offers little resistance against explosions.
Wool is very often used as a building material for maps in differentgame modes.Bloxd HopandEvil Towerparkouris made mostly out of Wool. Due to Wool being available in many different colours, it's often used to discern between teams like inBedwarsandPirates.
The easiest way to break Wool is withShears.
Carpets are Blocks used for decoration. They are transparent, meaning they work with the transparency glitch. You need 2 Wool of any colour to make 8 Carpets of any colour in anArtisan Bench. Carpets do not need a Block placed below them, making them useful for traps and builds. The appearance of a carpet when placed is like a Block of wool but way thinner. Carpets cannot be placed vertically. When a Carpet is being held in your hand, it looks like aBoardbut colored with a black outline.
A Carpet has the same hitbox as a full Block.
Carpets are one of the Blocks that you can walk through. Others include Boards, Potion Tables, Flowers, etc., while Carpets work the best in disguise. This information can be used to make traps.
Note that you have to use NORMAL Cactus to substitute Tall Grass in the Green/Cyan Wool recipe.
The best tool to break Wool is Shears, making it a pretty nice Block in PvP due to not much people put Shears in their hotbar.
Carpets were added to many maps when they were added, like Murder Mystery.
Carpets are useful for traps, builds and secret entrances.
When you walk on a surface covered by a Carpet, the sound made is the sound of the block below the Carpet since you are technically walking through the Carpet and not on it. However, if you jump, you can hear a bit of the Carpet sound which sounds like walking on grass.

WorldsInfoDescriptionCreate your own worldDeveloperArthur
This gamemode was deleted from the game, for a better World System UI.
The "Worlds" game mode affords players the ability to establish personalized lobbies, granting access to a comprehensive array of game modes, with the notable exception of certain secretive and specialized modes that remain inaccessible at present. There are also special variants of theSurvivalgame mode named "Hardcore” and “Lifesteal” which can temporarily ban people, move max HP between people, or disable natural regeneration. In aWorldslobby, the lobby can be in any of the Worlds game modes if you are the owner. It is recommended to open an Open World, as you can’t use most ownercommandsin other minigames even if you are the owner of the game. For a list of Worlds, clickhere.
You cannot placeProtectorswithin a 192-block radius of true spawn (0, 0), and there is a 21Xx 20000Yx 21zarea around true spawn where you cannot breakBlocksor use Moonstone Explosives, but you can place Water with Water Buckets.

To create a World, click the Worlds game mode in the main Bloxd menu. Press "Create World". Choose a name for your World. Keep in mind that:
World names can't be a number, but can contain numbers.
World names can't have profanity.
Two Worlds can't share the same name.
You can use special symbols and emojis in world names (i.e. _, -, !, 😀, 😃, 😄).
Next up choose the type of the World. There are currently 14 available:
This is the recommended type when you create a World. For more info see below.

to replace to, e.g [ "Grass Block" Water] ]
with another type of block
placed in other worlds.
Not to be confused with Gamemodes. These are only available in Open Worlds.
Worlds Game Modesare Game Modes that appear inWorlds. They are different from regular Game Modes because they are only in the Worlds Game Mode rather than the main screen. For example, you will never seeHardcoreon the main page ofBloxd.io. The owner of the World can set the default game mode which everyone will be put into once they enter the World. The owner can also update each player's game mode separately. Note that you can only update a player's game mode if that player is in the lobby, so be careful as to who you allow to edit. They might come while you're away and grief your World.
Survival is the default Worlds Game Mode. In this mode, you have a health bar which depletes if you get hit by another player. You die at a lobby owner-set height if you fall into the Void.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "s" or "0".
SurvivalAdventure is a game mode likeSurvival, but the only difference is you can't mine or place Blocks. You can, however, open Chests, openDoors and Trapdoorsand hit other players in SurvivalAdventure. You can also interact with tables such as aWorkbenchorFurnace.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "sa" or "3".
You can configurehardcoremode with /hardcore.
If you die in Hardcore, you don’t respawn, but if lifesteal is toggled, you do respawn with less max health. You get banned if your maximum HP is 0.
Peaceful is a game mode where PvP is not possible.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "p" or "2".
PeacefulAdventure is a game mode likePeaceful, but the only difference is you can't mine or place Blocks. You can, however, open Chests, Doors, and Trapdoors and interact with Utility Blocks.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "pa" or "4".
Creative is a game mode where you can build anything from pixel art to huge mansions and more. It is a game mode where the player has the freedom to explore and create in the infinite Open World. Players can fly.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "c" or "1".
Spectator is basically the adventure version of Creative. This game mode is like Creative, but the only differences are that you can't mine or place Blocks. You are also invisible, like you drank an infinite InvisibilityPotion. However, you do not have the Invisibility effect. There is a glitch where in spectator mode if your in a world lobby you will be able to use the creative menu. You can also drop items as well.
This game mode's abbreviated name is "sp" or "5".
Note: This game mode does not exist anymore.
The None Game Mode was a game mode that set your game mode to the default game mode. If you were in any other game mode and the default game mode changed, even if you were in that game mode, your game mode would not change. However, setting one's game mode to None after assigning them a specific mode would change their game mode when you changed the Default Mode.
The owner of an Open World has additional commands they can use to create the right experience for the players. The commands are:
tp requests
Protectors
Tribe Creation
Lobby Spawn
Keep Inventory
There is more commands; please clickhere.
Upon selecting a Game Mode from the Main Menu, a scrollable list becomes available, allowing you to browse through both public and personal Worlds tailored to that specific Game Mode. For instance, to join a Custom One Block Lobby, simply click on One Block, scroll down, and select "Explore". This will display a curated list of Worlds, all of which are specifically designed for One Block gameplay.
A Worlds browser previously existed, allowing players to browse a curated list of 30 prominent Worlds, showcasing their names, descriptions, and types. The list was dynamically updated to prioritize Worlds with the highest player counts, displaying them at the top. Although the browser capped the displayed player count at 19, it was still possible to join lobbies with 20 or more players. During periods of low player activity, the browser would also display empty Worlds. To join a World, players could simply click on its name.
Lots ofDYKstalk about worlds, especially creating one.
In older versions, you could place protectors around true spawn, meaning that servers with chunks around true spawn protected are very old.
The default gamemode used to bePeacefulbefore it was changed to Survival.
Chunks near spawn won't reset, unlikeSurvival,Peaceful,CreativeandFactions.
You can use the"Press to" boardsif you are the owner of the world.
In non-Open World gamemodes, you dont have most of the owner commands.
You cannot createBingoandRocket Spleefas worlds lobby.
Players in adventure mode can no longer open chests(not includingMoonstone Chests)
The world system got revamped.

AWritableis an Item that you can write on. There are currentlythreefour in the game:Boards,Books,Name Tag, and Code Blocks.WritablesA Name Tag, Book and Board

The Board, with the special arrow symbol on it (type -> on board)
TheBoardis a special transparentBlockthat can be used to store text. Boards can convert the symbols->and<-into these symbols:→and←as seen on the right, but they're patched due to new font settings. The text has three sizes: small, medium and large. This helps to convey messages differently, as if you want to warn about something or title something, you can use the large size, or if you are writing a long username or a short paragraph about something, you would use the small size. If your word is too long the text will go to the next row, even if the word is not complete.
Boards appear as a thin, rectangular prism with the MapleWoodPlanks texture on it.
You write on a Board by pressing[E]or right-clicking while aiming at it. A new UI appears that allows you to type choose from the three text sizes. Click on the side of the Board to publish what you wrote. It is possible to put emojis on Boards.
If you are the owner of an OpenWorld, you can create special Boards that activate when you[Right-Click]or press[E]. There are nine types of boards: 'press to get' Boards, 'press to lobby' Boards, 'press to tp' Boards, 'press to buy' Boards, 'press to mode' Boards, 'press to damage' Boards, 'press to execute' Boards, 'press to message' Boards and 'press to sell' Boards. If you have multiple Special Boards next to each other, they will all activate, unless one fails to activate ( for "press to buy/sell", not having enough items to buy/sell ) then the chain will activate up to that sign but not past. You can edit 'Press to __' Boards by Right Clicking/Pressing "E".
A press to get Board behaves similarly to command Blocks fromMinecraftwith the /give command. It gives a certain amount of a certain type of Items to the player who presses it. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
If you do not have enough room on one line, such as '999Moonstone Orb', you can put the 'Moonstone Orb' bit on a new line, and it would still work. When typing a specific Item name, be sure to use the correct name, or the Board won't execute the command (e.g. Type 'Block ofDiamond' instead of "diamond block"). Never use the plural form of the item name.
The item name mustn't be a specified number, you can also write for example 1-10 Dirt to give out a random count of items.
A press to lobby Board teleports you to the specified lobby.  To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
This only works in the Worlds gamemode because there is no owner of the public lobbies.  (Note that the "press to" parts are not caps-sensitive)
A press to tp Board teleports you to the specified coordinates. To create one, you need to type these on the Board:
A press to buy Board allows
to buy a certain thing for a certain price. The Items are generated by the game. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
A press to sell Board allows users to sell a certain thing for a certain price. To create one, you need to type the following on the Board:
Added on December 10, 2024 (however it was possible to do before, it just wasn't listed anywhere as a function), this board is used to sell all the items in your inventory to buy nothing, replacing the old feature where you had place many chests just to perform the same effect

If you are the publisher (the last person to edit the Book), the Book will say that you made the Book, stating "Book by [Player Name]". You can copy/paste from and into the Book. a
Books can be stored inBookshelvesandMailboxes.
This was added along with the Name Tag.
When the Book was added, there was a secret message hidden in the Book left byStardueon the last page of every Book. It read, "Arthur stinks. - Stardue". These messages were removed soon from all Books.
The swear filter exists in Books.
If you create a Book inSkywarsand write on it, it will not save.
If you place a Book in a chest then mine the chest, the book will be empty.

A Name Tag
TheName Tagis an Item that can be used to rename other Items. Name Tags can only rename non-stackable Items, likeFoodandEquipment. The Name Tag is NOT aPlayer Name Tagand cannot renameentities. The descriptions of renamed Items will still stay after renaming them.
The Name Tag can not rename a Name Tag or Book, even though they're not stackable.
If the item that you renamed has been changed, the new name will disappear.
Changing an item includes:
Using aWater Bucketor filling an emptyBucket
Turning a Coconut into aCracked Coconut
Drinking aPotionthat was renamed
Eating Bowl ofRiceorCranberries
The Name Tag appears as a beige tag with a white hook on top.
The UI after right clicking while holding a Name Tag
Right click while holding the Name Tag in your hand. This will send you to an UI that looks somewhat like a Board.
Write the name you want the Name Tag to rename an Item Into.
Click "finish". The renamed Tag will be in your hand, called "Rename to: [Item name]."
In your Inventory, grab it with your mouse and click with it on the Item you want to rename.
Once dropped on the Item, the name tag will disappear, and the Item is renamed.
You cannot rename currently equipped armor.
The Name Tag was added along with the Book.
The Name Tag was created byStardue.
Unlike before, now if you give a renamed Item to a different player, the rename will still be there.
If you die with a renamedItemin yourInventory, the rename will be still there.
The censoring system still exists, so you cannot name anything inappropriate.
Unlike inMinecraft, you can name an Item "Name Tag".
You are able to press enter to make a new row in name tags, making the Item name can go upwards.
The longest discoveredItemname is something like this: ‘**************************$&!’, with a total of 29 characters. You can do this by naming it: "fu fu fu fu fu …" until you run out of space. This will trick the swear system into thinking it is the f word, so it is phrased into *****. “Fu” is 2 characters long, while ***** is 5 characters long. Meaning it will get a 3 extra character bonus, breaking the system.
If you place a Name Tag inside a chest and break the chest, the Name Tag will be empty.
If you place a renamed item into a chest and break the chest, the item name will change back to its default name.

To actually get to max experience, you need to use 30Aura XPPotions to get to 300 XP. People in creative can also just simply use Splash Aura XP Potion 30 times to test enchantments.
Try to build a large chili pepper farm. Make it around 15x15 blocks in total, and then start farming the chili peppers. You might come up with at least 1 Aura Xp orb. Second, store it in a chest. This will help it save how many you have. Also, plant it on red sand AND besides lava. Although it’s 15x15, make sure it’s like islands or criss-cross hatching.
Or you can try building a mob farm, for hostile mobs. Next, if you have a spawner, try to place it and make sure it fits in the hole. Also, place spikes on the bottom so the mob will die faster. Additionally, hurting with the swords avoid wasting time. Finally, add a trapdoor at the bottom of the farm. Open the trapdoor to see if you got any loot.
XP Fragments (obtained from a Salvaging Table using minerals) give 1 level each, and three can be crafted into a singular XP Orb. However, the XP Fragments take more than three times as fast to eat as XP Orbs, making it more efficient to use XP Fragments for fast leveling. However, XP Orbs cannot be uncrafted into XP Fragments.
