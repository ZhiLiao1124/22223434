# Entity Settings

An "Entity Setting" impacts how a player sees or interacts with another player or entity.
E.g. Player 1 could have an otherEntitySetting for entity 2 as opacity set to 0.5. This means player 1 sees entity 2 as partly see-through. Player1 is the relevant player, player2 is the targeted player.
These API methods allow you to modify entity settings:

```js
/**
 * Set every player's other-entity setting to a specific value for a particular player.
 * includeNewJoiners=true means that new players joining the game will also have this other player setting applied.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} targetedPlayerId
 * @param {Setting} settingName
 * @param {OtherEntitySettings[Setting]} settingValue
 * @param {boolean} [includeNewJoiners]
 * @returns {void}
 */
setTargetedPlayerSettingForEveryone(targetedPlayerId, settingName, settingValue, includeNewJoiners)

/**
 * Set a player's other-entity setting for every player in the game.
 * includeNewJoiners=true means that the player will have the setting applied to new joiners.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} playerId
 * @param {Setting} settingName
 * @param {OtherEntitySettings[Setting]} settingValue
 * @param {boolean} [includeNewJoiners]
 * @returns {void}
 */
setEveryoneSettingForPlayer(playerId, settingName, settingValue, includeNewJoiners)

/**
 * Set a player's other-entity setting for a specific entity.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} relevantPlayerId
 * @param {EntityId} targetedEntityId
 * @param {Setting} settingName
 * @param {OtherEntitySettings[Setting]} settingValue
 * @returns {void}
 */
setOtherEntitySetting(relevantPlayerId, targetedEntityId, settingName, settingValue)

/**
 * Set many of a player's other-entity settings for a specific entity.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} relevantPlayerId
 * @param {EntityId} targetedEntityId
 * @param {Partial<OtherEntitySettings>} settingsObject
 * @returns {void}
 */
setOtherEntitySettings(relevantPlayerId, targetedEntityId, settingsObject)

/**
 * Get the value of a player's other-entity setting for a specific entity.
 *
 * @param {PlayerId} relevantPlayerId
 * @param {EntityId} targetedEntityId
 * @param {Setting} settingName
 * @returns {OtherEntitySettings[Setting]}
 */
getOtherEntitySetting(relevantPlayerId, targetedEntityId, settingName)
```

Here is the full list of available entity settings:

 * 0 opacity will hide the entity but not its name tag
 * @type {number}
 */

 * @type {boolean}

/**
 * Whether you can see damage amounts when shooting the entity
 * @type {boolean}
 */

/**
